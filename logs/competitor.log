Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster will maximize my chances in the next battle. The previous team used indices [0, 1, 2], and since this is the first battle, there's no prior result to base it on. My goal is to select a new team that's strong against whatever I might be facing.

First, I'll look at each Pokémon's type because understanding their strengths and weaknesses is crucial. Type effectiveness can really change how effective moves are in battle.

Starting with index 0: Type DARK, Max HP 106. Dark types are usually good against Fighting, Ice, and Normal types, but weak against Bug, Fairy, and Light Screen Terrain. So, if I'm facing a Normal type, this could be a problem because my Pokémon would have low effectiveness. But since it's also strong against Ice, it might still be useful in cooler environments.

Index 1: Type GHOST/POISON, Max HP 130. Ghosts resist Poison and are strong against Dark, Ice, and Ground types. They're immune to most Ghost moves, which can be a big advantage. However, if I'm facing a Ground type, this Pokémon might not be as effective because Ground resists Ghost moves.

Index 2: Type POISON/GROUND, Max HP 110. Poison is strong against Grass, Water, and Electric types, but it's weak against Ground because of the type matchup. Also, since it's dual-type, I have to consider both Poison and Ground strengths and weaknesses.

Looking at other indices, there are some strong candidates. For instance:

- Index 17: Type DARK/DRAGON, Max HP 160. Dragon types are strong against Ice, Rock, and Water. This Pokémon would be great if the opponent has a Water type, but not so much against Grass or Electric.
  
- Index 30: Type FIGHT/BUG, Max HP 116. Fighting is generally good against Dark, Ice, and Normal, while Bug is strong against Grass and Ground. This could cover multiple bases.

- Index 49: Type STEEL, Max HP 143. Steel resists Rock, Fire, Water, and Electric, but it's weak against Ice and Grass.

I should also think about the team composition. Maybe having a mix of types that cover different weaknesses would be better. For example, having a Ghost/ Poison for versatility, a Ground/Poison for terrain control, and a Dragon/Dark to handle specific types like Water or Ice.

Wait, but since this is my first battle, maybe I should focus on what's most effective overall rather than just against specific types. High HP and strong moves are important. Let me consider the previous team which was [0,1,2], so they used Dark, Ghost/Poison, and Poison/Ground.

Maybe sticking with similar types but higher HP would be better. Looking at indices 17 (Dark/Dragon) has high Max HP of 160, which is good for survivability. Index 30 (Fighting/Bug) also has decent HP, and index 49 (Steel) is another strong choice. Alternatively, perhaps using a Ghost/Normal could help with moves like Haunt or something.

Wait, but maybe I should look at each Pokémon's moveset to see what they can do in battle. For example:

- Pkm 17: DARK/DRAGON has some powerful moves like Power 140 and can switch types, which might be useful.
- Pkm 30: FIGHT/BUG has Rock moves which are good against many types and Tailwind for a boost.
- Pkm 49: STEEL has Light Screen, which is great for protecting the team.

I think these three together would provide a balanced team with coverage over multiple types. They can handle various opponents because of their diverse types and strong movesets. Plus, their high HP helps in surviving tougher battles.

Alternatively, maybe including a Ghost or Poison type could be useful against Dark or Ground opponents. But considering the previous team already used some similar types, adding more might not be necessary. Instead, focusing on different strengths like Steel's resistance to Electric and Rock could be beneficial.

So, after evaluating their types, move sets, and HP, I think selecting indices 17, 30, and 49 would form a strong team that can handle various opponents effectively.

Okay, so I need to figure out a new Pokémon team from the given roster based on the previous success. The last time, I used indices 17, 30, and 49, which won me the battle with an Elo of 1215. Now, I have to choose another set that might do well next time.

First, let's look at what each Pokémon in my last team does. Index 17 is a Dark/Dragon type with decent HP and some good moves like Ground, Reflect, and Rock. Index 30 is a Fighting/Bug type with Rock moves and Electric, which can be useful against certain types. Index 49 is Steel with Electric and Ice moves, which provide versatility.

Now, I need to replace one or more of these if necessary. The goal is to maximize the chances in the next battle. I should consider each Pokémon's type coverage, their moves, and how they complement each other.

Looking through the roster, there are a few types that could be good additions. Dark type is already covered by index 17. Maybe adding a Ghost or Poison type would help against certain opponents. Also, having a mix of types like Rock, Ground, and maybe Ice can provide coverage against multiple enemies.

I notice that index 30 is Fighting/Bug. Maybe replacing it with another type could be beneficial. Let's see what other Bug types are available. Index 5, 8, 19, 20, 21, and others are Bug types. Some have higher HP or better moves.

Wait, but I don't want to remove index 17 because it's a strong Dark/Dragon with good moves like Reflect and Rock. Maybe keeping that one is wise. Similarly, index 49 is Steel/Electric, which is versatile, so maybe keeping that as well. So perhaps only replacing the third member, index 30.

Looking for a good Bug type. Index 5 has Max HP 160 with some strong moves, but it's a Bug/Ghost. Maybe not necessary to replace unless I find a better fit. Alternatively, index 8 is a Bug with higher HP (154), so that might be a solid choice.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Rock type would help since my team doesn't have a pure Rock. Index 14 is Rock/BUG and has decent moves. But I need to decide between keeping 30 or replacing it.

Wait, index 30's type is Fighting/Bug. If I replace it with a Rock type, I can cover more defensive typings. So perhaps remove 30 and add 14 (Rock/BUG). Let me check if this makes sense.

So the new team would be 17 (Dark/Dragon), 14 (Rock/BUG), and 49 (Steel/Electric). This gives coverage in Dark, Rock, Steel, Electric, and Bug. It also includes Reflect from index 17, which could help against certain attacks.

Alternatively, maybe keeping 30 is better because it can cover Fighting moves which might be useful against certain opponents. But I need to balance the types. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps adding a Ghost type would help, as my current team lacks it. Looking for a good Ghost type. Index 1 is Ghost/POISON and has high HP (130). That could provide additional defensive capabilities and coverage.

So maybe keeping 17 and 49, and replacing 30 with 1. Then the team would be 17, 1, 49. This gives Dark/Ghost, Steel/Electric, and covers more type matchups.

Alternatively, perhaps a mix of types is better. Let me think about what's needed in the next battle. Usually, having a variety of types that can cover each other's weaknesses is key. Maybe having Rock, Ground, and Ice coverage is important.

Looking at index 17: Dark/Dragon
Index 30: Fighting/Bug
Index 49: Steel/Electric

If I remove 30, which is Bug/Fighting, and add a Rock type like 14 or 26, that could help. So team becomes 17, 14, 49.

Alternatively, if I want to keep the Bug type for bug-resistant moves, perhaps replace 30 with another Bug. Let's see:

- Index 5: Bug/Ghost
- Index 8: Bug (Max HP 154)
- Index 19: Bug
- Index 20: Bug/POISON

So replacing 30 with index 8 would give a strong Bug type.

But then the team would be 17, 8, 49. Dark/Dragon, Bug, Steel/Electric.

This setup provides good coverage against many types and has high HPs, which is beneficial.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Ghost type (index 1) along with another type could be better. So 17, 1, 49. Dark/Ghost, Steel/Electric.

I think the key is to have types that can cover each other's weaknesses and provide a variety of resistances.

Another consideration: Max HP. Indexes 8, 30, and 49 all have decent or high HP, so removing someone with lower HP might be better for longevity.

Looking back, my last team had indexes 17 (HP 160), 30 (116), and 49 (143). So replacing the one with the lowest HP first makes sense. That would be index 30 (HP 116).

So I can replace 30 with a higher HP Bug type like index 8 (154). So the new team would be 17, 8, 49.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Ghost and Rock. But since I only need to pick three, perhaps two types plus another.

Wait, but considering that my previous team had Dark/Dragon, Steel/Electric, and Bug/Fighting, replacing the Fighter with another type could help in terms of type coverage.

I think I'll go with keeping 17 (Dark/Dragon) and 49 (Steel/Electric), and replace 30 with index 14 (Rock/BUG). So 17, 14, 49.

This gives me Dark/Rock, Steel/Electric, Bug. It covers multiple types and has good defensive moves like Reflect.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a Ghost type would be better, so replacing 30 with index 1 (Ghost/POISON).

So team becomes 17, 1, 49: Dark/Ghost, Steel/Electric.

Either way, both setups seem solid. But considering the previous success, maybe keeping similar types is good. Since last time we had Dark/Dragon, which was index 17, and now adding Ghost might help with future matchups against Ghost-type enemies.

But without knowing the exact opponent types, it's hard to say. So perhaps a balanced team is better.

Alternatively, considering that in the previous battle, the team won, so maybe keeping the same types but replacing one for higher HP or better moves.

Looking back at the last result: The Elo increased, so they were successful. So their current team was effective.

In any case, I'll have to choose between a few options:

Option 1: Keep 17, 30, 49 (same as before)
But since they already used these indices, maybe it's better to rotate to avoid losing same types again.

Option 2: Replace 30 with another type like 8 or 14.
Option 3: Replace with a Ghost type for better coverage.

I think replacing 30 with index 1 (Ghost/POISON) might be beneficial because Ghost can help against many types and provide additional defensive boosts.

So the new team would be indexes 17, 1, 49.

Alternatively, if I want more Bug resistance, perhaps keeping 8 instead of 30.

Wait, but in the last battle they used 17, 30, 49. The opponent's type might have been something that these types are strong against.

So to prepare for different opponents, maybe adding a Ghost and Rock would be better.

But I'm not sure; without knowing the exact enemy types, it's hard.

Another approach: look at each Pokémon's moves and see what they can contribute. For example, if the team needs certain coverage or boosts.

Looking at index 17: Dark/Dragon
Moves include Ground, Reflect, Rock, etc.

Index 49: Steel/Electric
Moves include Electric, Light Screen, etc.

If I add a Ghost type (index 1), it has moves like Electrocute, which can help with Electric-type enemies.

So combining 17 (Dark/Ghost?), no, index 17 is Dark/Dragon. Index 1 is Ghost/POISON.

Wait, maybe the team should have:

- Dark/Dragon (index 17): Good physical attacks and Ground resistance.
- Ghost/POISON (index 1): Provides Ghost type, which resists many things like Normal, Water, etc., and can switch types via moves.
- Steel/Electric (index 49): Covers Electric and Steel, with defensive moves like Light Screen.

That seems like a strong team for various matchups. So indexes 17, 1, 49.

Alternatively, if I keep Bug instead of Ghost:

- Dark/Dragon (17)
- Bug/POISON (20: high HP, good moves)
- Steel/Electric (49)

This would also be effective, providing Bug and Dark resistance, along with Electric and Steel.

I think either way is viable. But since the last team had three types including Dragon and Steel, adding Ghost could provide additional coverage.

But I'm not sure if this is better than keeping Bug. It's a bit of a toss-up.

In any case, based on previous usage, they might need to rotate out some indices. Since their last team was [17, 30, 49], which won, maybe the new team should have similar types but different indexes to vary it.

Alternatively, look for Pokémon with high Max_HP and strong moves to maximize survival and damage.

Looking through the Roster:

Index 5: Bug/Ghost, HP 160. Moves include Ground, Reflect, etc.
Index 17: Dark/Dragon, HP 160. Moves include Ground, Rock, which are solid.
Index 49: Steel, HP 143. Good moves with Electric and other resistances.

Another option is to pick the three highest HP Pokémon, but their types need to complement each other.

Looking at Max_HP:

- Index 5: 160
- Index 7: 123
- Index 8: 154
- Index 17: 160
- Index 18: 104
- Index 19: 160
- Index 20: 160

So the highest are indexes 5,17,19,20.

But need to check their types:

Index 5: Bug/Ghost (good for multi-type)
Index 17: Dark/Dragon
Index 20: Bug/POISON

That's a lot of Bug. Maybe not ideal if the opponent is Bug.

Alternatively, mix and match.

Another approach: look at their moveset to see which provide offensive and defensive coverage.

Perhaps pick:

- Index 5 (Bug/Ghost): Good multi-type, high HP, good moves.
- Index 17 (Dark/Dragon): High HP, strong physical moves, resistances.
- Index 49 (Steel): High HP, Electric resistance, Light Screen.

This would cover multiple types and provide both offensive and defensive strengths.

Alternatively, replace with Ghost/POISON (index1) instead of Bug/Ghost. Since both are good.

But without knowing the exact enemy types, it's challenging. So perhaps go for a mix that covers different resistances.

Another thought: since the last result had Elo 1215, maybe they have some momentum to keep going with similar team compositions.

In any case, after considering all this, I'll choose to pick indexes 17, 30, and 49 again, but wait—they already used these in the past. Maybe it's better to rotate.

Alternatively, perhaps choose other indices that are strong.

Looking at index 8: Bug, HP 154, good moves.
Index 17: Dark/Dragon, 160 HP
Index 49: Steel, 143 HP

So indexes 8,17,49.

These have high HP and useful types. Maybe this is a better team for the next battle.

Alternatively, another combination like 17,30,49 seems consistent but they've used those before.

I think it's best to pick three strong Pokémon with good types that complement each other.

Another consideration: look at their movesets for key abilities or boosts that can help in battles.

But without knowing the exact opponent's type weaknesses, it's hard. So perhaps stick with high HP and useful types.

Based on all this, I'll choose the team with indexes 17,30,49 as they have strong stats and types.

Alright, I need to help someone create a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'm given the previous team indices [17, 30, 49]. Since their last team lost, my goal is to find a better combination for the next battle. The user provided a list of 50 Pokémon templates with their types and moves.

I remember that in Pokémon battles, having type coverage is crucial. Each Pokémon's type can counter others, so I should look for complementary types. Also, considering moves like priority, accuracy, and PP might help in ensuring they survive longer or deal more damage.

Looking at the previous indices [17, 30, 49], let me check what those Pokémon are:

- 17: Dark/Dragon with Max HP 160.
- 30: Fight/Bug with Max HP 116.
- 49: Steel with Max HP 143.

So their types are Dark/Dragon, Bug/Fight, and Steel. That gives some type coverage but might be lacking in certain aspects. Since they lost last time, perhaps their moves didn't perform well or the opponents had better strategies.

Now, I need to choose three new Pokémon from the roster. Let's consider each type:

Dark: Can pair well with Dragon for super effective moves.
Bug: Good against Dark and Ground.
Fight: Covers multiple types like Ice, Rock, etc.

Looking at the Roster, I should pick the strongest available Pokémon that can complement each other. Maybe focusing on types that have strong moves and good stats.

Let's look for high Max HP to survive longer. For example:

- PkmTemplate 17 is Dark/Dragon with 160 HP.
- PkmTemplate 30: Fight/Bug, 116 HP.
- PkmTemplate 49: Steel, 143 HP.

These are all quite strong, but maybe there's a better combination. Alternatively, perhaps adding more defensive types or ones with healing moves could help.

Wait, in the given Roster, looking for high HP and strong moves. Maybe focusing on types that can deal consistent damage and have good accuracy and PP.

Another approach is to look at each Pokémon's type effectiveness against others. For example, Dark is super effective against Ghost/ Poison, Bug is good against Dark and Ground, etc.

I should also consider the moves: priority, recoil, accuracy, PP, etc., as these can affect battle performance.

Looking through the Roster again, perhaps selecting:

- A Dark/Poison Pokémon for its resistance to Bug moves.
- A Fighting type for coverage against multiple types.
- A Steel/Dragon for strong physical attacks and good defense.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Ghost or Poison type could help counter certain moves.

Wait, the previous team included 17 (Dark/Dragon), which is already a good choice. Maybe replacing one of the others with a more effective Pokémon.

Looking at PkmTemplate 32: Flying/ Bug, Max HP 111. It has strong moves but might be weak against certain types.

Alternatively, PkmTemplate 30 is Fight/Bug, which pairs well with Dark and can handle multiple threats.

I think sticking with the previous team's structure but perhaps replacing one member could help. For instance, if Steel (49) is kept for its resilience, perhaps adding another strong type like Dragon or Ghost.

Wait, but in the Roster, there are other strong options. Let me check each possible combination.

Another thought: Maybe selecting types that have multiple resistances and strong defensive moves. For example, PkmTemplate 17 has Reflect which can block attacks.

Perhaps also considering the last result where they lost, maybe their team lacked in certain area like priority or healers.

Wait, but without knowing the exact opponents, it's hard to adjust. So, the best approach is to pick Pokémon that have strong stats, good moves, and complementary types.

After reviewing, I think indices 17, 30, and 49 are still a solid choice because they cover multiple types and have high HP. Maybe their specific moves didn't perform well last time, but as a new team, it's a balanced selection.

Alternatively, maybe replacing one of them with another strong Pokémon would improve the team. For example, if I replace PkmTemplate 30 with another Bug type that has better moves or stats.

Looking at PkmTemplate 5: Bug/Ghost with Max HP 160. It has a wide range of moves and high HP, which could be beneficial. So perhaps choosing 5 instead of 30 might be better.

Alternatively, considering the user's previous selections, maybe they prefer certain types. But without more info, it's safer to choose strong all-rounders.

I think after evaluating, keeping 17 (Dark/Dragon), 30 (Fight/Bug), and 49 (Steel) is a good strategy because they cover multiple types and have solid stats.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what Pokémon team to choose next. The user provided a lot of information about the current situation and the Roster. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I see that the last battle was won, and the Elo is now 1216.40. The previous team indices used were [17, 30, 49]. So, those three Pokémon were effective in their last match.

Now, I need to choose a new team of three Pokémon from the Roster to maximize chances in the next battle. The goal is to select indices that complement each other, possibly covering different types and having strong moves that can handle various opponents.

Looking at the Roster:

- **Index 17**: Type DARK/DRAGON, HP 160. Moves include GROUND, which is good for coverage, and Reflect to reduce damage.
- **Index 30**: Type FIGHT/BUG, HP 116. Moves like Rock and Electric give it solid ground and electric coverage.
- **Index 49**: Type STEEL, HP 143. This Pokémon can handle both Electric and Water attacks with its moves.

The last team won, so maybe sticking with similar types that worked before could be beneficial. However, I should also consider diversity in types to counter different opponents better.

Analyzing the types:

- **Dark/Dragon (17)**: Covers Dark and Dragon types, which are versatile.
- **Fight/Bug (30)**: Combines Fighting for physical attacks and Bug for bug-type resistances.
- **Steel (49)**: Offers resistance against Electric and Water, which are common in many matchups.

Looking at the moves:

- Index 17 has Reflect, which is great for defense.
- Index 30 has Rock and Electric moves, providing ground and electric coverage.
- Index 49 can take on Electric and Water attacks, which are strong in the current meta.

Considering synergy, having a Steel type (49) to handle Electric and Water, a Bug/Fight (30) for physical damage and bug resistance, and a Dark/Dragon (17) for dark and dragon coverage seems balanced. This setup offers good defensive and offensive options without overlapping too much.

I also need to check if there are better alternatives. For instance, other Steel types or Dragon types might be strong, but the selected indices have been effective before. There's no indication that they underperformed in their last matches, so keeping them makes sense.

Additionally, I should avoid introducing new types that might not have been tested yet unless there's a specific reason to do so. Since the previous team won, it's probably best to stick with what worked and add a new member if needed, but here we're replacing all three.

In conclusion, selecting indices 17, 30, and 49 seems like a solid choice for the next team. They cover multiple types, have strong moves, and were effective in their last outing.

Okay, so I need to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster would be best for the next battle. The previous team that won had indices 17, 30, and 49. My task is to choose a new team that can maximize chances of winning.

First, I should look at what each Pokémon in the previous team does. Let me check their types:

- PkmTemplate 17: Type DARK/DRAGON
- PkmTemplate 30: Type FIGHT/BUG
- PkmTemplate 49: Type STEEL

So they cover DARK, DRAGON, and STEEL types along with BUG and FIGHT. That's a mix of offense and defensive types.

Now, looking at the current roster, I need to find Pokémon that can complement or counter the previous team's strengths and weaknesses. Since the last battle was won, maybe the new team should have similar strong points but perhaps improve on weak areas.

Let me go through each Pokémon in the roster:

0: Type DARK - This could be good since they already have a DARK type.
1: Type GHOST/POISON - Good for poison and ghost, which can be useful against certain types.
2: Type POISON/GROUND
3: Type STEEL/DRAGON
4: Type ICE/DRAGON
5: Type BUG/GHOST
6: Type GHOST/NORMAL
7: Type FAIRY/GHOST
8: Type BUG
9: Type NORMAL
10: Type PSYCHIC
11: Type ROCK/POISON
12: Type NORMAL
13: Type ROCK
14: Type ROCK/BUG
15: Type FLYING
16: Type DRAGON
17: Type DARK/DRAGON (already used)
18: Type GHOST/WATER
19: Type BUG
20: Type BUG/POISON
21: Type BUG
22: Type PSYCHIC
23: Type DRAGON/STEEL (similar to 49)
24: Type NORMAL/ELECTRIC
25: Type GHOST
26: Type ROCK
27: Type DARK/FLYING
28: Type WATER/NORMAL
29: Type FAIRY/DRAGON
30: Type FIGHT/BUG (already used)
31: Type FIGHT
32: Type FLYING/BUG
33: Type FIRE
34: Type NORMAL/PSYCHIC
35: Type POISON/FLYING
36: Type WATER/GROUND
37: Type ICE
38: Type GRASS
39: Type POISON
40: Type GHOST/NORMAL
41: Type ICE
42: Type DRAGON
43: Type ROCK
44: Type POISON/DARK
45: Type ELECTRIC
46: Type PSYCHIC
47: Type PSYCHIC/ELECTRIC
48: Type BUG/DARK
49: Type STEEL (already used)

Now, I need to choose three that would work well together. Let's think about the previous team's types and what they can cover.

The new team should ideally have:

- Good coverage against common Pokémon types.
- Strong offensive moves.
- Defensive capabilities to counter strong moves.

Looking at the types available in the roster, perhaps adding a Ghost or Poison type could help with certain resistances. Also, considering that Steel is already used (49), maybe another type like Rock or Electric would be good for coverage.

Alternatively, since Bug was used in 30 and 5, maybe another Bug type could provide good versatility.

Looking at the options, perhaps PkmTemplate 1: GHOST/POISON could add both ghost and poison types, which are useful against various opponents. PkmTemplate 8: BUG adds another Bug type, which is great for switching. PkmTemplate 39: POISON adds more poison, which can be useful.

Alternatively, maybe PkmTemplate 17, 30, 49 were good, so maybe sticking with similar types could work.

Wait, but the user wants a new team, so perhaps not including the same exact templates again unless necessary.

Looking for high Max HP and strong moves. For example, PkmTemplate 48: Type BUG/DARK has Max_HP=89, which is decent. Maybe adding that would give Bug and Dark types.

Alternatively, maybe using PkmTemplate 5: BUG/GHOST, which adds Ghost as well.

Wait, but the previous team already had a Bug type (30) and Steel (49), so adding another Bug could be good for coverage.

Let me think about the types each Pokémon covers:

- Pkm48: BUG/DARK
- Pkm1: GHOST/POISON
- Pkm39: POISON

So combining these would give coverage in Ghost, Poison, Bug, Dark. That's pretty versatile.

Alternatively, maybe Pkm17 (DARK/DRAGON), Pkm30 (FIGHT/BUG), and Pkm49 (STEEL). But those were the previous team, so maybe not to reuse them unless necessary.

Wait, but the user says "a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster that will maximize your chances in the next battle." So it's okay if some are similar as long as it's a different combination. Or perhaps they just want three different ones, regardless of previous use.

But looking back at the example given: the user provided [17, 30, 49], so maybe they can include the same indices again.

Wait, no, because in the example, the output was ---14, 30, 49--- which are different from the previous team. So perhaps the new team should not have any of the previous ones? Or is it allowed to reuse them?

Wait, the user says "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster that will maximize your chances in the next battle." So it's a new team, but doesn't specify whether they can reuse previous indices. Probably, yes, because sometimes Pokémon can be reused if they're still effective.

But looking at the previous team, they had 17 (DARK/DRAGON), 30 (FIGHT/BUG), and 49 (STEEL). So maybe the new team should have similar types but different templates.

Looking again:

Roster has:

- Pkm1: GHOST/POISON
- Pkm5: BUG/GHOST
- Pkm8: BUG
- Pkm17: DARK/DRAGON
- Pkm30: FIGHT/BUG
- Pkm39: POISON
- Pkm48: BUG/DARK

So perhaps using 1, 5, and 39 would give Ghost, Poison, Bug coverage.

Alternatively, maybe 1 (Ghost/Poison), 8 (Bug), and 39 (Poison) for more poison.

But I'm not sure which combination is better. Alternatively, maybe the previous team was effective because they had certain moves that worked well. Since their Elo increased, perhaps their team composition was strong.

So to maximize chances, perhaps sticking with similar types but different Pokémon could be good.

Looking at Pkm1: Ghost/Poison has Max_HP=130, which is decent. Moves include Fire, Electric, etc.

Pkm5: Bug/Ghost has higher HP (160), so more survivability.

Pkm39: Poison only, Max_HP=129.

Alternatively, maybe choosing higher HP ones for better durability.

Wait, but the goal is to maximize chances, not necessarily HP. But in battles, higher HP can mean more survival against attacks.

But I'm not sure how the moves and types interact. Maybe certain combinations are better for dealing with different opponents.

Given that the last team was successful, perhaps similar strategies would work again, so maybe including similar types.

Alternatively, considering the previous team's indices: 17 (DARK/DRAGON), 30 (FIGHT/BUG), 49 (STEEL). So their types were Dark, Bug, Steel. So adding another Steel or another type that complements these.

Wait, but in the current Roster, Pkm48 is BUG/DARK, which could be a good addition to replace one of them.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to pick Pkm1 (GHOST/POISON), Pkm30 (FIGHT/BUG), and Pkm49 (STEEL). But that's similar to the previous team.

Wait, but in the example given, the user had [17, 30, 49] previously, then the new team was [14, 30, 49]. So maybe they can include some same indices as long as it's a different combination. Or perhaps not. It's unclear.

But in any case, I need to choose three indices from the Roster that are allowed and provide good coverage.

Looking at the types:

- Pkm48: BUG/DARK
- Pkm1: GHOST/POISON
- Pkm39: POISON

So combining these would give coverage for Bug, Dark, Ghost, Poison. That seems versatile.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Rock type for Ground coverage.

Pkm13: ROCK, but it's Max_HP=87, which is lower.

Or Pkm26: ROCK/BUG, which has higher HP (122) and covers both Rock and Bug.

So perhaps using 26 (ROCK/BUG), 1 (GHOST/POISON), and 39 (POISON).

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to focus on strong attackers or support types.

Alternatively, looking at Pkm30: FIGHT/BUG has Max_HP=116, which is decent. Its moves include Rock, Electric, etc.

So perhaps including that in the team would be good for versatility.

But without more info, it's hard to say. So maybe a safe bet is to use similar types as before but different Pokémon.

Alternatively, since the previous team had indices 17, 30, 49, which were DARK/DRAGON, FIGHT/BUG, and STEEL. Maybe replacing one of them with another type that complements.

Looking at Pkm48 (BUG/DARK), which could replace Pkm17.

So new team: 48 (BUG/DARK), 30 (FIGHT/BUG), 49 (STEEL).

But that's still two Bug types, which might be redundant unless it's good for something.

Alternatively, maybe choosing different types altogether.

Looking at the Roster, there are many options. Maybe focusing on high HP and strong moves.

Pkm5: BUG/GHOST, Max_HP=160, which is very high. Pkm39: POISON, Max_HP=129. Pkm1: GHOST/POISON, Max_HP=130.

So perhaps 5 (BUG/GHOST), 39 (POISON), and 1 (GHOST/POISON) would be a strong team with good coverage and HP.

Alternatively, considering the previous team's success, maybe maintaining some of their types is better.

But without knowing exactly what led to their victory, it's hard. So perhaps choosing the highest HP Pokémon available.

Looking through the Roster:

- Pkm5: 160
- Pkm7: 123
- Pkm9: 132
- Pkm10:86
- Pkm17:160
- Pkm20:160
- Pkm22:120
- Pkm25:77
- Pkm26:122
- Pkm27:105
- Pkm28:108
- Pkm29:129
- Pkm30:116
- Pkm31:45 (low)
- Pkm32:111
- Pkm33:141
- Pkm34:117
- Pkm35:136
- Pkm36:160
- Pkm37:135
- Pkm38:75 (low)
- Pkm39:129
- Pkm40:96
- Pkm41:121
- Pkm42:109
- Pkm43:150
- Pkm44:129
- Pkm45:128
- Pkm46:142
- Pkm47:127
- Pkm48:89 (low)
- Pkm49:143

So the highest HP is 160, which is in multiple Pokémon like 5,17,20.

But perhaps choosing a team with two 160s and another. But I can only choose three.

Alternatively, perhaps selecting the best attackers or balance.

But without knowing the exact battle mechanics, it's hard to optimize.

Given that, maybe choosing the three highest HP Pokémon: 46 (142), 5 (160), 17 (160). So indices 5,17,46.

Wait, but I need to see their types as well. Maybe combining types for coverage.

Looking at Pkm30: FIGHT/BUG, Max_HP=116. Its moves include Rock and Electric.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing a team with different types for coverage, like one of each type needed.

But without knowing the opponent's type, it's hard to choose.

Given that, maybe the best approach is to use the previous successful team but replace some with higher HP or better types.

The previous team was 17 (DARK/DRAGON), 30 (FIGHT/BUG), 49 (STEEL).

Looking at their types: DARK, FIGHT, STEEL. Maybe adding more coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps replacing 17 with another type, like GHOST or POISON.

But without knowing the opponent's weaknesses, it's tricky.

So perhaps selecting a team that includes strong attackers and good support.

Looking through the Roster again:

Pkm5: BUG/GHOST, Max_HP=160. Moves include Ground, Electric, etc.

Pkm7: FAIRY/GHOST, 123 HP.

Pkm9: NORMAL, 132 HP.

Pkm30: FIGHT/BUG, 116 HP.

Perhaps a team of Pkm5 (BUG/GHOST), Pkm30 (FIGHT/BUG), and Pkm49 (STEEL). That gives BUG twice, but maybe that's good for certain strategies.

Alternatively, to have different types: maybe Pkm5 (BUG), Pkm1 (GHOST/POISON), Pkm9 (NORMAL).

But it's a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the best is to use the previous team and replace with higher HP.

So replacing 17 with Pkm5 or 30 with another.

Wait, the user says that in their last battles, they used indices [17,30,49] multiple times.

Given that, maybe sticking with those types but ensuring high HP.

Looking at:

Pkm17: DARK/DRAGON, Max_HP=160. One of the highest.

Pkm30: FIGHT/BUG, 116.

Pkm49: STEEL, 143.

So perhaps keeping these three would be good.

Alternatively, checking for any better options in the Roster with similar types but higher HP or better moves.

But I think it's acceptable to return their indices again since they've been winning before. So ---17,30,49---

But wait, the instruction says to choose a new team that will maximize chances next time. If the previous team was successful, maybe keeping it is good.

Alternatively, if the last result was a win, perhaps using the same team is fine.

So I think returning 17,30,49 as indices would be acceptable.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. So, let me break this down step by step.

First, I see that the last result was a win with an Elo of 1250.62. The previous team used indices [17, 30, 49]. Now, I need to select three new Pokémon from the roster to maximize chances in the next battle.

Looking at the Roster, each Pokémon has a Type, Max_HP, and Moves. My goal is to pick the best combination that can counter the last opponents or adapt based on previous strategies.

The previous team used [17, 30, 49]. Let me check those:
- 17: Dark/Dragon with decent moves for offensive and defensive.
- 30: Fight/Bug, which could be physical attackers.
- 49: Steel with good defensive and physical moves.

Since the last battle was a win, maybe I should stick with strong, versatile Pokémon. But also, consider any weaknesses or strengths that might have been lacking before.

Looking at the Roster, I notice some high HP options like 5 (Bug/Ghost), 8 (Ghost/ Poison), 17 (Dark/Dragon), etc. Maybe adding a Ghost type could help with switching types effectively, as Ghost resists many attacks.

Wait, also, the last team's moves might have covered certain types well. Adding a Pokémon that can cover multiple types or has strong moves against common opponents could be beneficial.

Another consideration is the effectiveness of their moves. For example, having a Dragon type can be versatile since Dragon attacks are effective against multiple types. Also, Steel is good for defense and resistances.

I should also think about the previous team's moves. If they used certain types effectively, maybe adding another strong type that complements or contrasts would be good.

Looking at the Roster again, perhaps choosing 17 (Dark/Dragon), which is already in the last team, but adding others like 30 (Fight/Bug) and a Ghost type could balance offense and defense.

Wait, let's see: The previous indices were [17, 30, 49]. So maybe replacing one or more to improve. For example, if I replace 49 with a Ghost type for better coverage, that might be good. Alternatively, maybe keeping the strong ones but adding another strong attacker.

Alternatively, perhaps 17 (Dark/Dragon) is great because Dark has good resistances and Dragon is versatile. 30 (Fight/Bug) adds physical power. And adding a Ghost or Poison type for more versatility in attacks.

Looking at the Roster, I see that 8 is Ghost/ Poison with high HP and solid moves. Maybe adding 8 could provide better defensive capabilities through Ghost type, which resists many attacks.

So, putting it together: Keep 17 (Dark/Dragon) as a strong, versatile choice. Add 30 (Fight/Bug) for physical damage. And add 8 (Ghost/ Poison) for defensive purposes and good moves.

Alternatively, another thought: Maybe 17, 30, and 49 are all strong individually. Perhaps it's better to keep the team that worked before but maybe tweak one for a stronger option. For example, if I replace 49 with another strong Steel type or add someone like 8 for better defensive coverage.

But since the user wants exactly three indices, perhaps keeping the same or slightly modifying as needed. However, sometimes rotating can help avoid counters or exploit weaknesses.

Wait, but I should stick to what worked before and maybe improve it where possible. So, if the last team was [17, 30, 49], which won, maybe keep those and add another strong Pokémon. But since exactly three are needed, perhaps replacing one with a better fit.

Alternatively, maybe choosing the top three based on stats or move effectiveness. For example, looking for high HP, good moves, etc.

Looking at the Roster again:

- 17: Dark/Dragon, Max_HP=160, Moves include Ground, which is good for defense.
- 30: Fight/Bug, Max_HP=116, with Rock and Electric moves.
- 49: Steel, Max_HP=143, with Electric and Water.

All of these seem solid. Maybe adding another strong type like Ghost or Poison for better defensive coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing 17, 30, 8 as the new team since 8 is a good Ghost/ Poison type which can complement both in attack and defense.

But I'm not sure if that's better than keeping 49. Alternatively, maybe 17, 30, 49 are still strong, so keeping them could be best.

Wait, but perhaps the user wants to vary the team to avoid being predictable or to exploit new strategies. Maybe replacing one with a better fit.

Alternatively, considering the previous result was a win, maybe sticking with what worked is safest, while also making slight improvements where possible.

I think the key is to select the best three based on their effectiveness and how they can complement each other in battle. So, I'll need to evaluate each Pokémon's Type coverage, Max_HP, and move set to determine which trio is strongest.

After considering all factors, I believe selecting indices 17, 30, and 8 would provide a balanced team with strong offensive and defensive capabilities.

Okay, I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their previous battle results. Let me see what information I have. The last result was a win with an Elo of about 1269.87. Their previous team used indices [8,17,30]. So I should look at those Pokémon and think about how well they did.

First, let's recall each Pokémon from those indices:

- Index 8: Type BUG, Max_HP 154, Moves include Electric, Dark, etc.
- Index 17: Type DARK/DRAGON, Max_HP 160, with some strong moves like Ground, Rock, etc.
- Index 30: Type FIGHT/BUG, Max_HP 116, has Rocky moves and some Electric.

Now, the user wants to maximize their chances next time. I should consider what types are effective against others and which Pokémon have high accuracy or powerful moves.

Looking at the Roster, I need to find three Pokémon that can complement each other, maybe covering different types or strengths. Let's see:

- Maybe a Ghost type for support since it can help with priorities and switches.
- A Dragon type because they are strong against many others.
- A Rock type for defense and coverage.

Looking at the indices provided and the Roster, I think:

- Index 17: DARK/DRAGON is already great. It can cover multiple types and has good moves.
- Maybe index 30: FIGHT/BUG can add some physical attack options.
- What about a Ghost type? Looking through the list, maybe index 18 or 6. But index 6 is GHOST/NORMAL, which could be useful for priority moves.

Wait, but the user's last team was [17,30,8]. So perhaps to switch one for a better fit. Maybe replace index 8 with a Ghost type? Let me check the Roster again.

Alternatively, maybe include a Rock type like index 26: ROCK, which is strong against Water and Grass. But I don't know if that's necessary yet.

Wait, the last battle was won, so maybe they want to keep some of their previous winners but swap for better options.

Looking at the Roster again, perhaps choosing:

- Index 17: DARK/DRAGON (already in the team)
- Index 30: FIGHT/BUG
- Maybe replace index 8 with a Ghost type. Let me check which Ghost types are available.

Index 6 is GHOST/NORMAL, Max_HP 157. That might be better than the previous choice. Or maybe another type that's strong against common enemies.

Alternatively, perhaps index 18: GHOST/WATER could add some Water resistance and Ghost moves which are good for priorities.

So considering all this, a new team could be [17,30,6] or [17,30,18]. Alternatively, if they want to keep the BUG type, maybe replace it with another strong type.

Wait, but perhaps I should look at each Pokémon's strengths. For example:

- Index 8: BUG is good against Grass and Ground, which are common in the roster.
- Index 17: DRAGON is versatile.
- Index 30: FIGHT/BUG can handle Rock and Electric moves.

If I replace index 8 with a Ghost type, that might add more versatility. So maybe [17,30,6] as the new team.

Alternatively, if I think about each Pokémon's role:

- 17 is a Dragon, which is strong against many types.
- 30 is Bug/Fight, which can handle Rock and Electric moves.
- Adding a Ghost type would help with priority moves and switching.

So, after considering all this, I'll choose indices 17, 30, and 6 as the new team.

Alright, I need to figure out the best Pokémon team to use next based on the given information. The user provided a Roster of various Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves. They also mentioned that their last team won, so they probably want to continue using effective strategies.

The previous team indices were [6, 17, 30]. Let me check those Pokémon:

- Index 6: Type is GHOST/NORMAL. It has moves like Normal, Power 117, etc.
- Index 17: Type DARK/DRAGON. It has Ground and Rock moves, which are good for defense.
- Index 30: Type FIGHT/BUG. It uses Rock and Electric moves, which can help in battles.

So the last team had a mix of types like Ghost, Dark/Dragon, and Fight/Bug. Since they won, their strategy worked well. Now, I need to choose three new Pokémon from the Roster that might complement each other or counter the previous team's weaknesses.

Looking at the Roster, I should consider what types are strong against others. For example, Ghost is weak against Rock and Bug, so maybe including a Rock type would be good. Also, since Dark/Dragon was used before, perhaps adding another Dragon type could help, but I need to ensure they don't overlap in weaknesses.

I also notice that index 14 is Rock/BUG, which can counter Ghost and Bug types. Index 30 is already on the team, so maybe I should replace one member.

Wait, no, the instruction says to choose a new team of three indices, not necessarily replacing but selecting any three. But considering previous success, perhaps keeping some similar types makes sense while adding others that complement.

Looking for strong attackers or support Pokémon:

- Index 17 (Dark/Dragon) is already there.
- Index 6 (Ghost/Normal) might be good for supporting with Normal moves.
- Maybe add a Rock type to counter Ghost and Bug, so index 14 (Rock/BUG).

Wait, but index 30 is Fight/Bug. So adding another Bug type might not be the best if they're already using a Bug. Alternatively, maybe include a Dragon type for more coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing Pokémon that can handle common weaknesses or have strong moves that support each other.

Let me consider the types:

- Dark/Dragon (17) covers Ground and Rock.
- Ghost/Normal (6) covers Normal and Ghost.
- Maybe add a Steel type, which is strong against Rock and has good defenses. Looking at index 49: Type STEEL. It can handle Rock moves and has high HP.

So team would be [17, 6, 49].

Alternatively, if I want more offensive types, maybe index 30 (Fight/Bug) is already there, so perhaps replace one member.

Wait, but the user wants a new team of three indices, regardless of previous. So it's okay to include some from before as long as they are part of the Roster.

But since the last team won, maybe sticking with similar effective types would be better. Alternatively, trying different types that could exploit the same opponents.

Another approach: check each Pokémon's effectiveness against others.

For example, Ghost is weak to Rock and Bug. So having a Rock or Bug type can take advantage of that.

Dark/Dragon (17) can use Ground, which is strong against Flying, Ice, etc., but also has access to Dragon moves, which are strong against Ice and Steel.

Ghost/Normal (6) can cover Normal and Ghost types, which have their own strengths and weaknesses.

If I add a Rock type (like index 14), it can take down Ghosts and Bugs. Alternatively, adding a Dragon or Dark type might provide more coverage.

Wait, but the user's last team had indices [17,30,6]. So maybe they are fine with using those types again.

Alternatively, perhaps the new team could include:

- A Rock type (14) to counter Ghosts and Bugs.
- Dark/Dragon (17) for strong offense.
- Maybe a Steel type (49) for defense against Rock and to use Steel moves.

So [14, 17, 49] might be a good combination. Alternatively, maybe include a Fighting type, but index 30 is already there.

Wait, the user's last team was [6,17,30], so adding another Dark/Dragon (17) isn't necessary as it's already used. Maybe replace 30 with another type.

But the instruction doesn't say to replace; just choose three. So perhaps keeping 6 and 17, and adding another effective type like 49 (Steel).

So possible team: [6,17,49].

Alternatively, considering that the last result was a win, maybe including a strong attacker.

Looking back at the Roster:

- Index 30 is Fight/BUG with high HP and moves like Rock and Electric. It's already part of the previous team, so if I include it again, perhaps not necessary unless it's beneficial.

Wait, but the user wants exactly three indices regardless of prior use. So maybe including some from before could help maintain effectiveness.

Alternatively, if I'm unsure, I can look for Pokémon with high HP and strong moves that can take down common types.

For example, Dark/Dragon (17) is strong against Ice and Steel, has Ground moves which are good for defense, and Dragon moves which are strong.

Ghost/Normal (6) can handle Ghosts and use Normal moves effectively.

Steel (49) is strong against Rock and can protect the team with high HP.

So combining [17, 6, 49] seems balanced. Alternatively, adding a Bug type to counter Ghosts might be good, but since index 6 is already there, maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, including a Dragon type for more offensive power. But index 17 is already Dark/Dragon.

Wait, perhaps the user's last team had [6,17,30]. So if I choose [6,17,49], it's adding a Steel type which can help against Rock moves and provide good defense.

Alternatively, another approach: each member should cover different types or strengths. Let me see:

- 17: Dark/Dragon – covers Dark, Dragon, Ground (which is strong against Flying, Ice, etc.)
- 6: Ghost/Normal – covers Normal, Ghost
- 49: Steel – covers Steel

So together, they have coverage against multiple types and can handle various opponents.

Alternatively, if I include a Rock type (14) instead of Steel:

- 17: Dark/Dragon
- 6: Ghost/Normal
- 14: Rock

This would cover Dark, Dragon, Ground; Normal, Ghost; and Rock. It might be more balanced against different types.

But considering the previous team had indices [17,30,6], which are Dark/Dragon, Fight/BUG, and Ghost/Normal. So adding another type like Rock or Steel could provide better coverage.

I think I'll go with [14,17,49] as it includes Rock for counter-Ghost/Bug, Dark/Dragon for offensive and defense, and Steel for countering Rock and providing defense.

But wait, 14 is Rock/BUG. So having 14 and 6 (Ghost/Normal) can allow for multiple types to cover different weaknesses. Alternatively, perhaps including a Dragon or another type might be better.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal team includes:

- High HP: 17,30,49 all have Max_HP above 100.
- Effective moves: Each has strong moves that can contribute to battles.

I think [14,17,49] is a good choice. So I'll return those indices.

Alright, so I need to help build a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let's start by understanding what's provided.

The user provided a list of 49 Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves. They also mentioned that their last team lost, resulting in an Elo score of 1282.78. The previous team used indices [14, 17, 49], which I should consider for evaluation.

First, I'll need to assess the performance of the last team. Since it's a simplified Pokémon version, each Pokémon contributes based on their moves and types against the opposing team. However, without specific information about the opponent or the battle details, I have to make assumptions based on the available data.

Each Pokémon's effectiveness is influenced by its type matchups. For example, a Ghost/Poison type might be effective against Dark types due to not being affected by Ghastly's moves (like Haunt). Similarly, Rock/Poison can exploit certain weaknesses.

Looking at the previous team: [14, 17, 49]. Let's see what these Pokémon are:
- 14: Rock/Bug
- 17: Dark/Dragon
- 49: Steel

I should evaluate how each of these types fares against common opponents. Since the user lost last time, maybe their team composition was weak in some areas. Perhaps they lacked coverage against certain types or had ineffective moves.

To build a better team, I need to find Pokémon that can cover multiple types effectively and have strong moves. Maybe adding a Ghost/Poison for better coverage against Dark types or Bug-resistant Pokémon if the opponent has a lot of Bug types.

Looking at the roster, there are several options:
- 14 is Rock/Bug: Good for Ground and Rock resistance. Moves include Sand Stream, which can be useful but might not cover all weaknesses.
- 17 is Dark/Dragon: Can handle Ghost and Dragon types effectively, with moves like Shadow Force or Dragon Claws.
- 49 is Steel: Resistant to Rock and Ice, with moves like Iron Tail.

Perhaps adding a Ghost type could help against Dark Pokémon. Looking at the roster, index 18 is Ghost/Water. It has moves that can be useful, especially since Water can cover Ground moves but might not be as effective if the opponent has specific resistances.

Alternatively, maybe using a Psychic type for better coverage and utility. Index 22 is Psychic with good accuracy and moves like Tailwind, which could boost allies' attack.

I should also consider HP. Higher HP can help in maintaining momentum during battles. For example, index 36 is Water/Ground with high HP (160) and good moves like Hydro Pump and Ice Punch.

Wait, but the user's last team lost, so maybe they need more offensive or defensive presence. If their previous team was too defensive, adding a strong attacker might improve their chances.

Looking at index 5: Bug/Ghost with high HP (160). It has moves like Mega Drain and Shadow Force, which could be powerful against certain opponents. However, Bug can be weak to Rock moves, so pairing it with Rock types would help.

Another option is index 28: Water/Normal. It has Hydro Pump and Ice moves, which are versatile but might not cover all weaknesses unless paired with appropriate support.

I think the key is to have a mix of types that can handle each other's weaknesses. For example, having both Ground and Rock coverage can prevent being overwhelmed by Earth-based attacks.

Also, considering moves like priority or multi-type advantages could help in ensuring that the team can act effectively in combat.

In summary, I need to select three Pokémon from the roster that together cover a range of types, have good HP, and access to strong moves. They should complement each other's strengths to maximize their chances against the next opponent.

Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who is playing a simplified Pokémon game. They want me to choose a new team of three Pokémon from their roster based on previous performance and results. Let me break down what they've given me.

First, the last result was that their team won with an Elo of 1304.43. Their previous team used indices [14, 36, 49]. I need to figure out why these indices were chosen before and how effective those Pokémon are now.

Looking at the roster, each index corresponds to a specific Pokémon template with Type, Max_HP, and Moves. The user's goal is to maximize their chances in the next battle, so I should focus on selecting Pokémon that are strong against common opponents or have moves that can deal consistent damage.

The previous team used indices 14, 36, 49. Let me check what each of these Pokémon are:

- Index 14: Type=ROCK/BUG, Max_HP=157, Moves include Grass, Power 98, Accuracy 0.86, Physical, Probability 0.30, Target Boosts, Flying, etc.
- Index 36: Type=WATER/GROUND, Max_HP=160, Moves include Ghost, Power 140, Accuracy 0.96, Physical, GHOST, etc.
- Index 49: Type=STEEL, Max_HP=143, Moves include Electric, Power 116, Accuracy 0.84, Physical, Probability 0.17, SUN, WATER, Ice, etc.

These Pokémon seem to cover multiple types—Rock/BUG, Water/Ground, and Steel. Their moves include strong physical attacks and some special attacks, which could be effective against different opponents.

Since the team won last time, their current setup might have worked well. Now, I need to choose three new Pokémon that can continue this success without necessarily being the exact same types but with complementary strengths.

I should look for Pokémon that have high Max_HP, strong moves, and types that cover a range of weaknesses. Maybe including a mix of physical and special attackers, as well as good defenders or support units.

Looking through the roster again:

- Index 0: DARK type, decent stats.
- Index 4: ICE/DRAGON with Dragon moves, which can be powerful against Dragon-type opponents.
- Index 7: FAIRY/GHOST, which can be useful for different types.
- Index 8: BUG, strong with Electric and Dark moves.
- Index 14 is already used, so maybe not again unless necessary.

I also notice that some Pokémon have high Accuracy or Power, which can help in ensuring hits. For example, index 4 has ICE/DRAGON type with Dragon move, Power 118—very strong against Dragon enemies if needed.

Another consideration is the types they cover. Maybe having a Ghost, Rock, and Dragon could provide good coverage against various opponents.

Wait, but I need to pick three, so perhaps 4 (ICE/DRAGON), 7 (FAIRY/GHOST), and 14 (ROCK/BUG) as an alternative? Or maybe 4, 7, and another strong type like Dark.

Alternatively, perhaps 8 (BUG) because BUG can deal with Grass and Psychic types effectively. Also, index 17 is DARK/DRAGON, which could be a good addition for versatility.

Hmm, but I'm supposed to choose three based on the previous team's success. The last team used Rock/BUG, Water/Ground, and Steel. So maybe sticking with similar types in different Pokémon could maintain their effectiveness.

Looking at other options:

- Index 2: POISON/GROUND—could be good against Grass and Psychic.
- Index 3: STEEL/DRAGON—good for steel resistance and dragon attacks.
- Index 4: ICE/DRAGON—great for ice moves, supports Dragon types.

Alternatively, maybe 2 (POISON/GROUND), 4 (ICE/DRAGON), and 7 (FAIRY/GHOST). This mix covers Ground, Ice, and Ghost, which are useful against various enemies.

Wait, but the user's previous team had Rock/BUG, Water/Ground, Steel. So maybe a similar approach: choose three that cover multiple types effectively.

Alternatively, perhaps 36 is still good because it's Water/Ground, and then pick two others that complement it. Maybe 14 (Rock/BUG) again, but the user might prefer not to use the same indices unless necessary. Alternatively, 4 (ICE/DRAGON) could be a good fit for Dragon weaknesses.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The main goal is to choose three that can handle a variety of types, have strong moves, and perhaps synergy between them.

Looking at index 36: WATER/GROUND—useful against Ground enemies and supports Water moves. Index 14: ROCK/BUG—good against Grass and BUG types, with strong physical attacks. Index 49: STEEL—resistant to Rock and has strong moves.

Wait, but the user's last team was [14, 36, 49], which worked well. So maybe keeping similar indices would be safe. But perhaps they want a different combination that is still effective.

Alternatively, if I can't use the same indices, I might need to choose alternatives with similar strengths. For example, using index 4 (ICE/DRAGON) instead of 14 because it's also strong and has Dragon moves which can cover a lot.

I think the best approach is to pick three Pokémon that are versatile in type coverage, have high Max_HP, and strong moves. So maybe:

- Index 4: ICE/DRAGON for Dragon coverage.
- Index 36: WATER/GROUND for Water and Ground support.
- Index 49: STEEL for Steel resistance and Electric attacks.

Wait, but the user's last team already had similar types. Maybe include index 7 (FAIRY/GHOST) instead of 49, as Ghost is a good type against many opponents.

Alternatively, perhaps pick 36, 4, and 7: WATER/GROUND, ICE/DRAGON, FAIRY/GHOST. This covers multiple types and provides strong attacks.

But I need to ensure that the chosen Pokémon are effective against each other's weaknesses too. For example, if one is Ghost, it can handle Ground enemies, which index 36 also supports.

Alternatively, maybe go with 14, 36, and 49 again since they've been successful before. But the user mentioned "return exactly three indices", so maybe they don't want repeats unless necessary. Or perhaps it's allowed as per the instructions.

Wait, the initial problem says that in each call, you have to return a new team from the Roster. So the indices can be repeated? No, I think each time, you need to choose three different indices, so no repeats unless they are not used before. But since last time they used 14,36,49, maybe it's allowed to include them again if the algorithm thinks they are still strong.

But according to the instructions: "Return exactly three indices (no more, no less), comma-separated." It doesn't specify whether they can be repeated or not. So perhaps including previous successful indices is acceptable.

In that case, returning 14,36,49 again would be logical as they have been effective before. However, sometimes in Pokémon teams, you might want to rotate out weaker members for stronger ones.

Alternatively, maybe the user's last Elo was high (1304), so confidence is high in their current team. But without knowing the specifics of each Pokémon's effectiveness against others, it's hard to say.

But given that the user wants to "maximize your chances", perhaps keeping the same team that worked before is the way to go unless there are better options.

Looking at other strong candidates:

- Index 17: DARK/DRAGON—good for Dragon and Dark types.
- Index 4: ICE/DRAGON—great for Ice moves, supports Dragon.
- Index 36: WATER/GROUND—supports Water and Ground.

So perhaps replacing some of the previous indices with stronger ones could help. For instance, if index 14 is Rock/BUG, maybe replace it with index 17 (DARK/DRAGON) which has higher Max_HP and might have better moves.

But without knowing the exact battle mechanics and strengths against each other, it's difficult to make a precise decision.

Given the time constraints, I think the best approach is to choose the previous indices as they have been successful. So return 14,36,49 again.

Okay, so I'm trying to help build a Pokémon team based on the given templates. The user hasn't provided any previous battle results except that it's the first battle, so my goal is to pick three Pokémon that can handle their first encounter.

First, I need to look through each of the 49 templates and evaluate what makes them good for a new team. Since it's the first battle, I might want versatile Pokémon with strong moves that can adapt against different types.

I should consider the Type coverage—ideally, having a mix of types like Rock, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, etc., so the team isn't too weak against any particular type. Also, high Max HP is important for surviving initial attacks.

Looking at each template:

- Template 0: Rock type with decent moves and some resistances. It might be good for physical defense.
- Template 1: Fight type with a mix of Fire and Dragon moves. Good offensive options.
- Template 2: Electric/Water has Steel moves, which are strong against Rock and Ice types. Water is also good for switching.
- Template 3: Bug/Water. Water can be useful, and Bug might help with Grass or Psychic types.
- Template 4: Ground/Rock. Ground resists many attacks, and Rock adds more defense.
- Template 5: Ice/Water. Useful for counters and physical attacks.
- Template 6: Normal type. Good all-rounder with Dragon moves that are versatile.
- Template 7: Bug. Good against Grass and Psychic, but might be weak against Fighting or Fire.
- Template 8: Steel. Strong defensively and offensively with Normal and Dark moves.
- Template 9: Rock/Ghost. Ghost is good for resistances, and Rock adds physical defense.
- Template 10: Electric/Psychic. Electric has strong moves like Thunder, and Psychic can handle Grass and Fighting types.
- Template 11: Electric/Steel. Both types are strong, especially against Rock and Ice.
- Template 12: Electric. Good for offensive with Grass and Ground.
- Template 13: Ground. High HP and solid defense.
- Template 14: Bug/Flying. Flying is good for escaping or hitting grounded opponents, and Bug complements Grass.
- Template 15: Psychic. Good against Fighting types and has strong special moves.
- Template 16: Psychic/ Poison. Combines well with Poison's resistances.
- Template 17: Poison. Strong against Grass and Water, plus good defensive moves.
- Template 18: Dark. Useful for dealing with Psychic and Ground types.
- Template 19: Flying. Good mobility and access to Dragon and Ice moves.
- Template 20: Dragon. High damage with Normal and Ice moves.
- Template 21: Ghost. Strong against most types, especially in defense.
- Template 22: Bug/Ice. Combines Ice's strengths with Bug's resilience.
- Template 23: Flying. Similar to others but maybe less durable.
- Template 24: Ghost/ Poison. Good resistances and offensive moves.
- Template 25: Water/Dragon. Dragon is strong, Water adds flexibility.
- Template 26: Poison. Similar to others but higher HP.
- Template 27: Dark/Bug. Combines two solid types for versatility.
- Template 28: Fairy/Ground. Ground for defense, Fairy for offense and resistances.
- Template 29: Steel. High HP and strong against many types.
- Template 30: Fight/Rock. Rock is good for defense, Fight is versatile.
- Template 31: Steel/Water. Strong both offensively and defensively.
- Template 32: Dark. Good against Psychic and Ground.
- Template 33: Flying/Steel. Both types are strong for coverage.
- Template 34: Rock. High HP and solid physical defense.
- Template 35: Electric/Grass. Covers two useful types with good moves.
- Template 36: Water. Solid for special attacks and resistances.
- Template 37: Electric/Rock. Rock is great, Electric adds offensive power.
- Template 38: Psychic/Flying. Good against Fighting and Ice, plus mobility.
- Template 39: Fire/Dark. Fire has strong moves, Dark complements it well.
- Template 40: Rock/Ghost. Similar to others but with Ghost resistances.
- Template 41: Water/Psychic. Good for special attacks and defense.
- Template 42: Fire. Strong against Grass and Water, good HP.
- Template 43: Water. Similar to others with good moves.
- Template 44: Fight. Good for offensive and can handle Psychic types.
- Template 45: Dragon/Psychic. High damage from Dragon, strong against Fighting.
- Template 46: Dragon/Ground. Ground for defense, Dragon for offense.
- Template 47: Psychic. Similar to others but with self boosts.
- Template 48: Grass/Rock. Good coverage of both types.
- Template 49: Normal/Fairy. Normal is versatile, Fairy adds resistances and offensive.

Considering all this, I need to pick three that cover multiple types and have strong moves. Maybe a Rock type for physical defense, a Psychic or Dark type for versatility, and an Electric type with good coverage.

Looking at the options:

- Template 0: Rock, solid choice.
- Template 15: Psychic, which is versatile against Fighting.
- Template 31: Steel/Water, which can handle both offensive and defensive needs.

Alternatively, maybe go for a mix like Rock, Electric, and something else. Let's see:

- Rock (e.g., template 34) provides good defense.
- Electric (template 11 or 37) offers strong attacks against many types.
- Maybe add a Psychic type (template 45) for counters.

Wait, but the user wants three. So perhaps pick the best all-rounders.

Alternatively, high HP and strong moves:

- Template 13: Ground with high Max HP.
- Template 30: Fight/Rock, which can handle multiple types.
- Maybe add a Steel type like template 31 or 29 for resistance.

But the user wants three. So perhaps choosing the top three based on highest Max HP.

Looking at the max HP:

Template 13:144
Template 14:105
Wait no, looking through all templates:

Looking at each template's Max HP:

- Template 0:54
- 1:78
- 2:123
- 3:96
- 4:120
- 5:160
- 6:160
- 7:105
- 8:139
- 9:80
-10:104
11:95
12:96
13:144
14:105
15:160
16:130
17:119
18:117
19:113
20:135
21:121
22:128
23:85
24:160
25:85
26:160
27:158
28:102
29:124
30:114
31:141
32:144
33:141
34:154
35:117
36:71
37:111
38:80
39:91
40:110
41:78
42:89
43:87
44:54
45:74
46:142
47:160
48:134
49:120

So the highest Max HP is 160, which is templates 5,6,15,24,26, etc.

Then, perhaps pick three of them. But I need to think about their types and moves.

But maybe it's better to balance types rather than just HP.

I think in this case, since it's the first battle, any team should be okay, but choosing high HP and strong moves would help.

Wait, the initial instruction says "maximize your chances". So we need the best possible team.

Looking for a mix of types that can cover multiple weaknesses. For example:

- Rock type provides immunity to many attacks.
- Electric type can handle Flying, Ground, etc., with their moves.
- Maybe a Psychic or Ghost type to handle Fighting and other common types.

Alternatively, choosing templates that have strong multi-type coverage and high HP.

But perhaps the best approach is to pick three templates that are strong against each other's weak points. For example:

- Rock (resists Fighting, Ground)
- Electric (resists Water, Rock)
- Psychic (resists Fighting, Ice)

But I'm not sure about the specifics of how they interact.

Alternatively, considering that in Pokémon battles, having types that counter others is key.

Looking for:

1. A Rock type to take advantage of immunities against Fire, Water, etc.
2. An Electric type which can handle Flying and Ground, with good coverage.
3. A Psychic type which is strong against Fighting and has good support moves.

So perhaps choose templates 34 (Rock), 37 (Electric/Rock), and 15 (Psychic). But need to check their indices.

Wait, from the list:

- Template 34: Rock
- Template 37: Electric/Rock
- Template 15: Psychic

But let me see what each does.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to pick the top three highest HP templates that cover different types. The highest are 5 (160), 6 (160), and 15 (160). But they might overlap in type.

Wait:

Looking at template 5: Type is ICE/WATER
template 6: Type is NORMAL
template 15: Type is PSYCHIC

So that gives a mix of types, each with high HP. Maybe that's a good team.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to spread out the types for more coverage.

But since I'm not exactly sure about how to balance the types optimally, maybe I should go with the highest HPs and see their types.

The top three Max HP templates are 5 (160),6(160),15(160). So choosing those: indices 5,6,15.

Wait, but let me check if they have conflicting types. Template 5 is ICE/WATER; 6 is NORMAL; 15 is PSYCHIC.

So each covers a different type which could provide coverage against various opponents.

Alternatively, maybe other templates are better in terms of move sets.

For example:

- Template 34: Rock has Max PP 154 and some strong moves.
- Template 37: Electric/Rock with good stats.
- Template 32: Dark with high HP (144).

But I'm not sure if that's the best combination.

Alternatively, perhaps using templates with both Water and Ice types, but in this case, template 5 is ICE/WATER.

Wait, another approach: since it's the first battle, maybe any team would do, so choosing the three highest HP. The top three are 34 (154),32(144),31(141). But let me see:

- Template 34: Rock
- Template 32: Dark
- Template 31: Steel/Water

This provides a mix of types and high HP.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go with templates that have strong moves. For example:

Looking at template 5: Ice/Water has Moves like POWER 140 and ACCURACY 1.00.

Similarly, template 6 (NORMAL) has some strong moves like Power 140, Accuracy 0.95.

Template15 (PSYCHIC) also has good stats.

So perhaps choosing these three would maximize the chances.

Alternatively, maybe template 34 is Rock with Max PP 154 and strong moves. But I think that's a good choice.

Wait, but in the initial data, it's stated that this is the first battle; no prior result.

Therefore, any team can be chosen without worrying about past matchups.

So perhaps selecting three templates that are strong individually.

Looking at each template's move sets to see which have high Power and Accuracy.

For example:

- Template 5: ICE/WATER has POWER 140, ACCURACY 1.00
- Template6: NORMAL has POWER 140, ACCURACY 0.95
- Template15: PSYCHIC has some strong moves like POWER 140, ACCURACY 0.83

Alternatively, perhaps choosing templates with the highest Power.

Looking at each template's max power:

For example, template34 Rock has a move with POWER 140, ACCURACY 0.95.

Similarly, others have similar.

But without knowing the exact effectiveness against each other, it's difficult.

Given that I'm supposed to choose based on Roster and previous info which is first battle, maybe any team is acceptable. But perhaps choosing ones that are strong in multiple aspects.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to see a team with high HP and strong moves. So I'll go with 5,6,15 as they have high Max HP (160 each) and decent move sets.

Alright, let me try to figure out the best Pokémon team to use next. The last battle I won with a team of indexes [5, 6, 15], and now I need to choose a new one from the provided roster to maximize my chances.

First, I should look at what types were used before. Indexes 5, 6, and 15 correspond to:

- 5: Type ICE/WATER
- 6: Type NORMAL
- 15: Type PSYCHIC

So last time, I had Ice/Water, Normal, and Psychics. Now, considering the previous team's types, maybe sticking with similar or complementary types would be good.

Looking at the current roster, I should consider what each Pokémon brings to the table in terms of type coverage and effectiveness against others. Also, their stats like Max HP and moves could influence how effective they are in battle.

I need to choose three Pokémon that can cover multiple types effectively. Let me go through some candidates:

- Index 14: BUG/FLYING
- Index 30: FIGHT/ROCK
- Index 49: NORMAL/FAIRY

Let me analyze each of these:

1. **Index 14 (BUG/FLYING)**: Bug and Flying type coverage. Good for versatility, can check for bugs or flying types.
2. **Index 30 (FIGHT/ROCK)**: Fighting and Rock types. Good for physical attacks and coverage against certain types.
3. **Index 49 (NORMAL/FAIRY)**: Normal and Fairy types. Provides solid offensive options and coverage against fairies, which can be useful.

I should check if these types complement each other or provide coverage against common opponents. Also, looking at their Max HP might help in ensuring they can survive longer battles.

Another thing to consider is the moves each Pokémon has. For example, Rock-type Pokémon often have good physical moves and protection, which can make them reliable. Fighting types are also strong physically with good access to moves like Close Combat or Fling.

Between these three, I think having a mix of types that are either offensive or defensive would be beneficial. Rock/Fighting offers physical resilience, while Normal/Fairy adds offensive versatility.

I also need to ensure there's no overlap in types that could hinder effectiveness. For example, if two Pokémon are of the same type, it might not provide additional coverage but could lead to redundant attacks.

Looking at their stats:

- Index 14: Max HP 105
- Index 30: Max HP 114
- Index 49: Max HP 120

HP seems decent, so they should be able to handle most basic attacks unless facing strong moves.

Moves-wise, I need to check for things like priority, accuracy, and damage. For instance, Rock-type Pokémon often have moves that are reliable, like Protect or Stone Edge which can disrupt opponents.

I also wonder about the effectiveness against other types. Normal and Fairy types are good against a variety of opponents, while Bug can be useful against Grass and Water, and Flying can deal with Ground and Rock.

Considering all this, I think teaming up Index 14 (BUG/FLYING), 30 (FIGHT/ROCK), and 49 (NORMAL/FAIRY) would provide a well-rounded team. They cover multiple types, have decent HP, and their moves should offer good versatility for different battle situations.

I should also check if these were used before in the previous team or not, but since I'm starting fresh with this selection, it's okay.

Okay, so I have to help choose a new Pokémon team from the given roster based on the previous battle result and the last results. The user mentioned that it's their first battle, so there's no prior data. My goal is to pick three Pokémon that can maximize their chances in the next battle.

First, I need to understand what each Pokémon's Type is and what Moves they have. Each Pokémon has a Type, Max HP, and a list of Moves with their power, accuracy, PP, etc. 

Since it's the first battle, there are no past results, so I can't look at previous wins or losses. That means I need to consider all possible combinations, but that's too time-consuming. Instead, maybe I should focus on Pokémon that have strong moves against common types or have high accuracy and power.

Looking through the roster, I see a variety of Types: Water, Fairy, Grass, Rock, Poison, Bug, etc. It's important to have a balanced team with different Types to cover multiple weaknesses.

Let me go through each Pokémon:

0: Water/Fairy - Good Type coverage, has some strong moves.
1: Fight/Ice - Maybe not the best for first battle, but decent.
2: Grass/Electric - Good offensive and defensive moves.
3: Poison - Strong against Fairy and others, good move set.
4: Bug - Good against Grass and Poisson, but might be weak against others.
5: Fight - Not the strongest type for initial battles.
6: Rock - Solid defense and attack, useful.
7: Bug/Dark - Versatile with good moves.
8: Dark/Fight - Interesting mix, could be good.
9: Flying - Good against Ground and Rock, but might struggle otherwise.
10: Fire - Weak against Water, but has some strong moves.
11: Bug/Poisin - Similar to 4, maybe not the best for all situations.
12: Ground - Strong defense against many types.
13: Grass - Good offensive with Dragon moves.
14: Water - Solid, especially against Flying and Fairy.
15: Ghost - Can be tricky with Hex, but might require specific counters.
16: Ghost - Similar to 15.
17: Psychic/Ice - Strong mental moves, good defensive.
18: Electric/Fight - Versatile, decent all-rounder.
19: Normal - Good versatile moves.
20: Normal/Fairy - Similar to 0, good coverage.
21: Fire/Fairy - Similar to 20 with Fire added.
22: Ground - Same as 12.
23: Bug - Similar to 4 and 7.
24: Normal - Similar to 19.
25: Water - Similar to 14.
26: Dark/Normal - Good mix, strong against many types.
27: Fairy/Dark - Strong fairy type, good moves.
28: Bug - Same as others.
29: Rock/Ghost - Solid defensive and offensive types.
30: Bug - Same as before.

I think for the first battle, it's best to have a mix of strong Types that can cover each other. Maybe include Water, Grass, and Rock because they are versatile and have strong moves against many types. Alternatively, Electric/Fight or Dark/Normal could be good too.

Looking at their Max HP, 30 has 74 HP which is low, but maybe it's better to focus on more powerful types. For example:

- PkmTemplate 2: Grass/Electric with high Max HP (143).
- PkmTemplate 14: Water (64 HP) - decent.
- PkmTemplate 30: Bug (74 HP) - maybe not the best, but has good moves.

Alternatively, maybe 0 (Water/Fairy), 6 (Rock), and 8 (Dark/Fight). Rock can cover multiple types, Dark is versatile, and Water is strong against Flying. 

Wait, but the user wants to maximize chances, so perhaps choosing Pokémon with high Max HP and strong moves would be better. For example:

- PkmTemplate 2: Grass/Electric, high HP, good moves.
- PkmTemplate 14: Water, good type, decent HP.
- PkmTemplate 30: Bug, but low HP.

Alternatively, maybe PkmTemplate 26: Dark/Normal with higher Max HP (119), which can cover multiple types and has strong moves.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to go with the highest HP possible to survive longer in battle. So looking for high Max HP:

PkmTemplate 2:143, 36:146, 37:157, 20:160, etc. But they might have types that are weak against others.

Alternatively, maybe a mix of strong types and higher HP. 

Another approach is to look at the moves. For example, PkmTemplate 17 has Psychic/Ice with high Max PP and accuracy. That could be good for support.

But since it's the first battle, maybe focusing on diversity in Types is better. So perhaps pick Water, Grass, Rock.

Looking back, I think the best team would include:

- PkmTemplate 2: Grass/Electric - covers multiple types, high HP.
- PkmTemplate 14: Water - strong against Flying and Fairy.
- PkmTemplate 30: Bug - good against Ground and Poisson, but maybe not the strongest.

Alternatively, maybe include Rock for defense. PkmTemplate 6: Rock (121 HP) would be a solid choice.

So perhaps:

0: Water/Fairy (127 HP)
6: Rock (121 HP)
30: Bug (74 HP)

But 30 has low HP, so maybe that's not ideal. Alternatively, pick higher HP with strong types.

Alternatively, PkmTemplate 26: Dark/Normal (119 HP) which can cover a lot of types and has good moves.

Hmm, it's tricky. I think the best approach is to select three Pokémon with strong individual stats and complementary Types.

After considering all, I'll go with:

- 2: Grass/Electric for its high Max HP and versatile moves.
- 14: Water for strong type against Flying/Fairy.
- 30: Bug for coverage against Ground and Poisson, even though HP is low.

Alternatively, maybe include PkmTemplate 6 (Rock) instead of 30 for better defense. So:

---2, 14, 6---

Okay, I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their last loss and previous performance. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user provided a lot of data about different Pokémon templates. Each has a type, max HP, and a list of moves. The goal is to select three indices from this roster that will maximize the chances in the next battle. The previous team used indices [2, 14, 6], which lost their last match.

First, I should consider what factors make a Pokémon good for a team. High max HP is important because it can survive longer in battles. Moves with high power and accuracy can deal significant damage. Also, having moves that exploit weaknesses or provide status effects can be advantageous.

Looking at the previous team:
- Index 2: Type GRASS/ELECTRIC, Max_HP=143
- Index 14: Type WATER, Max_HP=64
- Index 6: Type ROCK, Max_HP=121

These types cover Grass, Water, and Rock. Maybe the next team should aim for complementary types that can cover different strengths.

Now, I need to evaluate each Pokémon's moveset to see if they have strong offensive or supportive abilities.

Let me go through each template:

0: WATER/FAIRY - High max HP, good moves.
1: FIGHT/ICE - Good Psychic and Ice moves.
2: GRASS/ELECTRIC - Strong Rock move and Tailwind.
3: POISON - Good Poison moves but lower HP.
4: BUG - Solid Grass and Poison moves.
5: FIGHT - Flying and Dark moves.
6: ROCK - Strong normal and toxic spikes.
7: BUG/DARK - High HP and good moves.
8: DARK/FIGHT - Nice moves, but max HP is 110.
9: FLYING - High HP, but moves might not be as strong.
10: FIRE - Low max HP, but good Fire moves.
11: BUG/POISON - Good Poison moves and Protect.
12: GROUND - Strong Ground and Ice moves.
13: GRASS - Solid Grass moves.
14: WATER - High Water moves, but low HP.
15: GHOST - Nice moves with Ignore Evasion.
16: GHOST - Similar to 15 but higher max HP.
17: PSYCHIC/ICE - Strong Psychic and Ice moves.
18: ELECTRIC/FIGHT - Good Electric and Dark moves.
19: NORMAL - Solid Normal moves.
20: NORMAL/FAIRY - Nice Fairy and Normal moves.
21: FIRE/FAIRY - High HP, good Fire/Fairy.
22: GROUND - Similar to others with Ground moves.
23: BUG - Strong Bug moves.
24: NORMAL - Another Normal template.
25: WATER - High Water moves, but lower HP than 14.
26: DARK/NORMAL - Nice moves but low HP.
27: FAIRY/DARK - Good Fairy and Dark moves.
28: BUG - Solid Bug moves.
29: ROCK/GHOST - Rock and Ghost moves.
30: BUG - Another Bug template with higher max HP.
31: DARK/POISON - High HP, good Poison moves.
32: ELECTRIC/NORMAL - Nice Electric and Normal moves.
33: GHOST/ROCK - Rock and Ghost moves.
34: POISON/FAIRY - Good Poison and Fairy moves.
35: GRASS/NORMAL - Solid Grass and Normal moves.
36: FAIRY/POISON - High HP, good Fairy and Poison.
37: FAIRY/FIRE - High HP, Fire/Fairy.
38: POISON/GRASS - Good Pois/Grass.
39: ROCK/DRAGON - Dragon and Rock moves.
40: FLYING - Similar to others but maybe weaker moves.
41: DARK/FAIRY - High HP, Dark/Fairy.
42: STEEL - Solid Steel moves.
43: DARK/GROUND - High HP, Ground/Dark.
44: FIGHT/FIRE - Fire and Fight moves.
45: WATER - High Water moves, similar to 14 but higher HP.
46: ROCK/FAIRY - Rock and Fairy moves.
47: DRAGON/STEEL - Dragon and Steel moves.
48: WATER - Similar to others with high moves.
49: STEEL - High Steel moves.

Now, considering the previous loss, it's probably good to include strong attackers or supportive Pokémon that can boost the team's effectiveness. Let me look for templates with high max HP, strong movesets, and types that complement each other.

Looking at index 7: BUG/DARK. It has a high max HP of 127, great Dark and Bug moves, including Protect which is useful. Its type could help against Ground or Psychic opponents.

Index 30: BUG. Max HP 74, but it has strong Ground moves and can switch types, making it versatile.

Index 49: STEEL. High HP, good Steel moves, and can switch types which helps cover different weaknesses.

Alternatively, index 37: FAIRY/FIRE. High HP, strong Fire and Fairy moves, which can be good against Dragon or Ice types.

Wait, but the previous team used Grass, Water, Rock. Maybe including a Electric type could help with some resistances.

Hmm, perhaps selecting indices 7 (BUG/DARK), 30 (BUG), and 49 (STEEL) would provide a strong mix of types and high HPs. Alternatively, adding a Ghost or Fairy type for support.

Wait, index 15: GHOST has Ignore Evasion, which is useful against certain attacks. But its max HP is lower than others.

Alternatively, index 17: PSYCHIC/ICE. It has good Psychic moves which can help against Fighting types and Ice moves which are strong.

I think selecting indices that provide a mix of high HP, strong attacking moves, and supportive abilities would be best. For example:

- 7 (BUG/DARK): High HP, Protect, great Dark/bug moves.
- 30 (BUG): Another Bug with good Ground moves.
- 49 (STEEL): High HP, Steel moves.

This combination covers multiple types and provides both offense and support.

Alternatively, adding a Ghost type like index 15 could add Ignore Evasion for defense. But since the previous team lost, maybe focusing on stronger attackers is better.

I think the best choice would be indices 7, 30, and 49 as they provide high HP, strong moves, and versatile types.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Pokémon to choose for my next battle based on the information given. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, I know that each time I call, I need to select a new team of three Pokémon from the provided roster. The goal is to maximize my chances of winning the next battle. The previous team was [7, 30, 49], and they won their last match, so I want to keep using strong Pokémon.

Looking at the Roster, each Pokémon has Type, Max_HP, and various Moves with their stats like Power, Accuracy, etc. My task is to analyze which three indices (from 0 to 49) would give me the best team.

I remember that in Pokémon battles, having a mix of types can be beneficial. Maybe I should look for types that are strong against each other or have coverage over common weaknesses. Also, considering the moves, I want Pokémon with powerful attacks and good accuracy or other supportive moves like Protect or Heal.

The previous team used indices 7, 30, and 49. Let me check what those are:

- Index 7: Type BUG/DARK, Max_HP=127. Moves include Dark, Power 110, Max PP 11, etc.
- Index 30: Type BUG, Max_HP=74. Moves have Ground, Power 133, Max PP 7, etc.
- Index 49: Type STEEL, Max_HP=116. Moves include Ice, Max PP 12, Priority 1, and others.

So their types are Bug/Dark, Bug, and Steel. That's a mix of Bug, Dark, and Steel. Maybe I should stick with similar types or find complementary ones.

Looking through the Roster again:

- Index 0: Water/Fairy. Good for switching types.
- Index 1: Fight/Ice. Maybe not as versatile.
- Index 2: Grass/Electric. Could provide Electric coverage.
- Index 3: Poison. Useful against Ghosts and Greens.
- Index 4: Bug. Another Bug option, which is good against Grass and Water.
- Index 5: Fight. Not sure about its effectiveness unless it's for physical attacks.
- Index 6: Rock. Good against Ice and Fire.
- Index 7: Already used.
- Index 8: Dark/Fight. Maybe a solid choice with both Dark and Fighting types.
- Index 9: Flying. Good for aerial attacks but might be weak against Ground.
- Index 10: Fire. Can be strong, but might not cover all weaknesses.
- Index 11: Bug/Poison. Another Bug option with Poison moves.
- Index 12: Ground. Can handle Rock and Grass.
- Index 13: Grass. Useful for Grass moves.
- Index 14: Water. Good against Flying and Ice.
- Index 15: Ghost. Good against Fighting and Bug.
- Index 16: Ghost. Similar to 15.
- Index 17: Psych/ICE. Can provide Special attacks and resistances.
- Index 18: Electric/Fight. Combines Electric and Fight.
- Index 19: Normal. Useful for a variety of types.
- Index 20: Normal/Fairy. Good for Fairy moves.
- Index 21: Fire/Fairy. Mix of Fire and Fairy.
- Index 22: Ground. Another Ground option.
- Index 23: Bug. Similar to others.
- Index 24: Normal. Same as 19.
- Index 25: Water. Another Water option.
- Index 26: Dark/Normal. Good for both types.
- Index 27: Fairy/Dark. Mix of Fairy and Dark.
- Index 28: Bug. Again, same type.
- Index 29: Rock/Ghost. Good against Ghosts and Rocks.
- Index 30: Already used.
- Index 31: Dark/Poison. Good for both types with poison moves.
- Index 32: Electric/Normal. Mix of Electric and Normal.
- Index 33: Ghost/Rock. Mix of two good defensive types.
- Index 34: Poison/Fairy. Combines Poison and Fairy.
- Index 35: Grass/Normal. Useful for Grass coverage.
- Index 36: Fairy/Poison. Mix of both.
- Index 37: Fairy/Fire. Fire and Fairy mix.
- Index 38: Poison/Grass. Good against Grass and Poison.
- Index 39: Rock/Dragon. Dragon is a good niche.
- Index 40: Flying. Same as before.
- Index 41: Dark/Fairy. Mix of Dark and Fairy.
- Index 42: Steel. Another strong Steel option.
- Index 43: Dark/Ground. Good for both types.
- Index 44: Fight/Fire. Fire and Fighting mix.
- Index 45: Water. Another Water choice.
- Index 46: Rock/Fairy. Mix of Rock and Fairy.
- Index 47: Dragon/Steel. Strong for Dragon and Steel.
- Index 48: Water. Another Water option.
- Index 49: Already used.

So, considering the previous team, I might look to replace one or two with stronger options that cover different weaknesses or have better stats. Since Steel is strong against Rock and Ice, but also has good defense, maybe keeping it is good. Bug is versatile against Grass and Water, so having another Bug could be beneficial. Dark is good against Psychic and Ice, which might help.

Looking at the Roster, Index 8 is Dark/Fight. Dark type can cover a lot of gaps, and Fighting provides strong physical attacks and access to moves like Close Combat, which are powerful. Also, index 43 is Dark/Ground, which could provide both Ground coverage and Dark moves.

Alternatively, maybe using a Ghost type would help against Psychic and Ground, but since we already have Steel (index49), which can handle some of those, perhaps adding another Ghost or a different type like Rock for better coverage.

Wait, I also have to consider the Moves each Pokémon has. For example, index 8 has moves like Dark, Power 110, Max PP 11, and others that could be beneficial. Index 43 is Dark/Ground, which can handle both types effectively.

Another option is index 44: Fight/Fire. Fire can cover against Grass, Water, and Ice, but I'm not sure if it's better than other options.

I think a good approach would be to include a mix of types that are strong against each other. For example, having a Rock type for Ground/Grass weakness, Dark for Psychic and Ice, and Steel for Ice and Rock. But in the previous team, they had Bug/Dark, Bug, and Steel.

Maybe I can replace one of them with something that covers more weaknesses or has better stats. For instance, index 43 is Dark/Ground, which could help against both Ground and Psychic teams. Alternatively, index 44 is Fight/Fire, which might be useful for physical attacks but may not cover as many type weaknesses.

Wait, considering the previous team had Bug, Dark, and Steel, maybe adding a Ghost or Rock would provide better coverage. For example, index 29: Rock/Ghost. Ghost can handle Psychic and Ground, while Rock covers Ice and Water. That could be beneficial.

Alternatively, index 31: Dark/Poison. Dark is good against Psychic and Ice, and Poison can handle Grass and Water.

Hmm, it's a bit tricky. I think the best approach is to choose three Pokémon that cover multiple types effectively and have strong moves. So perhaps:

- Keep one of the existing strong performers (like index49: Steel)
- Add another Dark type for coverage against Psychic and Ice
- Include a Rock or Ground type to handle Grass and Ice

Looking at the options, index8 is Dark/Fight, which would be good because Fighting can handle a lot of types through moves like Close Combat, but I'm not sure about its effectiveness. Index43 is Dark/Ground, which might be better for handling both Ground and Psychic.

Alternatively, perhaps including a Ghost type (like index15 or 16) along with Steel and another strong type could provide good coverage. But since the previous team had Steel and Bug, adding a Ghost would add another layer of protection against Ice and Ground.

Wait, but I need to pick three indices. So maybe:

- Keep index49 (Steel)
- Add index43 (Dark/Ground)
- Replace one of the existing with something else, like index7: Bug/Dark? Or perhaps index8 or 30?

Wait, the previous team was [7,30,49], which are Bug/Dark, Bug, and Steel. Maybe replacing one of them.

Looking at index30: Bug, Max_HP=74. If I replace that with a stronger Bug type, like index7 is also Bug but Max_HP=127, which is better. Or perhaps another strong type.

Wait, the problem is that we can only choose from the Roster as given. So, the new team should be three indices from 0-48 (since last time was 49). Wait no, the previous team had [7,30,49], but I don't know if 49 is allowed now or not. Because in the current problem statement, the user says "your last team won" with indexes [7,30,49]. But now, when choosing a new team, do we have to exclude index49? Or can we include it again?

I think Pokémon teams can reuse templates as long as they are allowed. So, unless there's a rule against using the same template multiple times, which I don't see here.

But wait, in this problem, each PkmTemplate is unique, but you can choose them again if needed. So, for example, index7 and 30 are both Bug types. So, including both in the new team might not be optimal because they're duplicates in type, but perhaps their moves differ enough to make them useful.

Alternatively, maybe replacing one of them with a more versatile Pokémon.

But without knowing the exact battle mechanics, it's hard to say which combination is better. However, considering that the previous team had a Bug, Dark, and Steel, perhaps adding a Ghost or Rock would provide better coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps using three strong all-rounders.

Wait, but since this is an AI, maybe choosing the top performing Pokémon in terms of Max HP, moves, etc., might be the way to go. So looking through the Roster, which have higher Max_HP?

Looking at the Roster:

- 0: 127
- 2:143
- 3:112
- 4:77
- 5:116
- 7:127
- 8:110
- 9:124
- 11:106
- 12:115
- 13:82
- 14:64
- 15:106
- 16:124
- 17:158
- 18:120
- 19:76
- 20:160
- 21:122
- 22:95
- 23:111
- 24:123
- 25:158
- 26:119
- 27:132
- 28:76
- 29:97
- 30:74
- 31:89
- 32:133
- 33:127
- 34:122
- 35:112
- 36:146
- 37:157
- 38:160
- 39:135
- 40:96
- 41:95
- 42:105
- 43:137
- 44:137
- 45:160
- 46:126
- 47:135
- 48:137
-49:116

So, the highest Max_HP is 160 (indices 20,38,45). So perhaps including those would be beneficial.

But considering that higher HP doesn't always mean better performance in battles, but more survivability. However, since the previous team won and we have an Elo of ~1200, maybe it's good to keep high HP for defense.

Alternatively, if the goal is to maximize damage, then perhaps choosing Pokémon with strong moves rather than just HP.

But without knowing exact battle mechanics, it's hard. So perhaps a mix of high HP and strong move sets.

Looking at the Roster:

- 17:158 HP, has Poison, Power 73, Accuracy 0.82, Max PP 13, etc.
- 20:160 HP, Fire, Max PP 8, Other, Self Switch, Steel, Power 122, etc.
- 25:158 HP, Water, Dragon, Max PP 13, Other, Toxicspikes, Heal 0.27, etc.
- 36:146 HP, Fairy/ Poison, Dark, Max PP11, Other, Rock, Normal, Acc 0.96, etc.
- 37:157 HP, Fire/Fairy, Rock, Acc 0.82, Max PP12, Other, Tailwind, etc.
- 38:160 HP, Grass/Poison, Ground, Power133, Max PP7, Special, etc.

These are some of the higher HP ones.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on types that can cover multiple weaknesses or have strong natures.

But without knowing the exact matchup info, it's difficult. So maybe picking a team with high HP and versatile moves.

Alternatively, considering that the last result was a win, perhaps we can take similar strategies. The previous team included Bug/Dark (index7), Bug (30), and Steel (49). Maybe the new team should include a mix of types that are strong against each other or have good coverage.

Looking at the Roster, perhaps:

- 0: Water/Fairy with high HP and some good moves.
- 2: Grass/Electric with high HP and useful moves like Rock and Tailwind.
- 7: Bug/Dark, which was part of the previous team but has higher Max HP now.

Alternatively, maybe choosing three types that can each cover different weaknesses. For example, a Water type to handle Fire, a Grass for Earth coverage, and a Dark/Steel for versatility.

But honestly, without specific info on the opposing team's types or moves, it's challenging. So perhaps selecting the top 3 HP Pokémon with the best move sets.

Looking at the Roster again:

- 20:160 HP, Normal/Fairy with Self Switch, Steel, etc.
- 38:160 HP, Grass/Poison with Ground, Power133, etc.
- 45:160 HP, Water with Dark, STEALTH_ROCK, etc.

These are all high HP and have strong moves. So perhaps choosing these three would be a good strategy.

But wait, the indices for them are:

- 20: Normal/Fairy
- 38: Grass/Poison
- 45: Water

Alternatively, maybe including a Dragon type or something with strong multi-type benefits.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon that have multiple types which grant various advantages, such as Electric, Rock, etc., because they can cover more ground in battles.

But again, without knowing the exact matchup, it's hard. So perhaps picking the highest HP with the most versatile move sets.

Looking at 17:158 HP, has good moves like Poison, Power 73, Accuracy 0.82, Max PP 13, and Protect. This seems like a solid choice for defense and offense.

20:160 HP, Normal/Fairy, Self Switch, Steel, Power122. Self Switch is useful for team synergy.

38:160 HP, Grass/Poison, Ground, Power133. Ground is strong against many types, including Rock and Water.

So combining 17 (for defense/ Protect), 20 (for Self Switch and Fairy/Normal), and 38 (Grass/Poison with Ground) might be a good team.

But wait, the previous team had [7,30,49], which are Bug/Dark, Bug, and Steel. The new team should aim to have different types or perhaps a mix that can cover each other's weaknesses.

Alternatively, maybe picking 17 (Psychic/Ice), 20 (Normal/Fairy), and 38 (Grass/Poison) as they have diverse types with good coverage.

But I'm not sure if this is the optimal approach. Maybe there's a better combination.

Another angle: looking for Pokémon that can learn moves that boost each other's stats or have strong synergy.

For example, 20 has Self Switch, which could support team members by boosting their effectiveness or defenses.

38 has Ground, which can counter Rock and Water, but also has Tailwind in some of its moves (like index2). Tailwind boosts Speed for the entire team, which is a significant advantage.

Looking back at the Roster, perhaps combining 20 (Self Switch), 38 (Ground/Tailwind), and another type that complements their weaknesses. For example, adding a Dragon type with Immunity or something similar could help against certain attacks.

Alternatively, maybe choosing a Ghost type for its immunities and resistances, like index15 or 16, but they have lower HP compared to others.

Wait, the previous team had Bug/Dark (index7), which is pretty strong with high HP. Maybe keeping one of them would be good for continuity.

Looking at index7: Bug/Dark has high Max HP (127) and some powerful moves like Power 110, Dark, etc. So perhaps including that in the new team.

Similarly, index30: Bug with high HP (74) and Ground/Steel coverage, along with Priority 1 moves.

And index49: Steel with good moves including Ice, Power92, etc.

So maybe the previous team had some success, so continuing with similar types but adding different ones might be better.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing a mix of strong single types that can cover each other's weaknesses.

In conclusion, considering all factors and without specific matchup info, it's challenging. But based on HP and move sets, I think selecting indices 0 (Water/Fairy), 2 (Grass/Electric), and 7 (Bug/Dark) would be a strong team.

Alright, so I need to figure out the best Pokémon team to use next. The last time I played, my team with indices [0, 2, 7] won, and now I have a new set of Pokémon available. My goal is to choose three that will maximize my chances in the next battle.

First, let me look at the Roster provided. There are a lot of templates here, each with different types, Max HP, and moves. Since it's a simplified version of Pokémon, I assume each move has specific effects, but since the details aren't fully expanded, I'll have to make educated guesses based on the given info.

My previous team used indices 0, 2, and 7. Let me check what those are:

- 0: Type WATER/FAIRY, Max HP 127. Moves include FIRE, other moves that change type, steel, etc.
- 2: Type GRASS/ELECTRIC, Max HP 143. Moves like Rock, Tailwind, etc.
- 7: Type BUG/DARK, Max HP 127. Moves with Dark and Ice.

Now, I need to pick a new team of three. The goal is to maximize chances, so I should consider the types that are effective against what I expect the opponent's team might have. But since I don't know the opponent's types, maybe I should focus on having coverage for various types or strong offensive/defensive capabilities.

Looking at the roster, I see a lot of BUGs, DARKs, FLYINGs, etc. Maybe I can pick some that are strong in certain areas. For example:

- 14: Type WATER, Max HP 64. Moves include Flying and Change Type.
- 30: Type BUG, Max HP 74. Ground moves and Light Screen.
- 49: Type STEEL, Max HP 116. Ice move, priority, etc.

Wait, but I have to think about their moves' effectiveness. For instance, Steel has moves that are good against various types. Water can be strong against Grass and Fire. Bug can handle Ground and Poison.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for high Max HP to survive longer. For example:

- 2: GRASS/ELECTRIC with high HP.
- 7: BUG/DARK with decent HP.
- Maybe another one like 35: GRASS/NORMAL with high HP.

But the previous team used 0 (WATER/FAIRY), so maybe avoiding similar types could help. Or maybe having coverage for different types is better.

Another approach: check which Pokémon have strong multi-type advantages or useful moves that can help in battle, like priority, healing, or boosts.

Looking at index 7: BUG/DARK has moves like Force Switch and others that might be helpful. Index 30: BUG with Ground moves and Light Screen. Index 49: STEEL with Ice move.

Alternatively, maybe include a Ghost type for surprise attacks or resistances. But I don't see many Ghosts in the recent indices.

Wait, let's think about their move sets more carefully:

- 14: WATER. Can be strong against Grass and Fire. Also has moves that change type, which can switch to Fairy, which is weak against Steel.
- 30: BUG. Ground and Light Screen are useful. Bug resists Grass and Poisson.
- 49: STEEL. Ice move is good for counterattacks. Also, Steel resists Rock and Ice.

So combining these types could provide a balanced team with coverage against various opponents. Water handles grass and fire, Bug handles ground and poison, Steel counters ice and rock. This seems like a solid combination.

Also, considering their Max HP:

- 14: 64
- 30: 74
- 49: 116

They have decent HP but not the highest. However, having a mix of high, medium, and lower might be better for team cohesion rather than just picking top-tier.

Another thought: Check if any of these Pokémon have moves that boost the team's effectiveness, like Tailwind or Light Screen, which 30 has (Light Screen) to reduce damage taken.

Alternatively, maybe including a Dragon type could help, but I don't see many in this roster. Wait, index 25 is Water/Dragon, but it's further down and might not be the best.

So, considering all, I think the team [14,30,49] would be strong because:

- 14: Water for grass/fire
- 30: Bug for ground/light screen
- 49: Steel for ice/rock

They cover a range of types and have useful moves. Plus, 30 has Light Screen which is good against Grass's Solar Beam.

I think this should give me a good chance in the next battle.

Alright, I need to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team for the next battle based on the given information. The user provided the Roster of available Pokémon templates and the last result that the team lost with an Elo rating of 1199.77. The previous team used indices [14, 30, 49].

First, I should analyze what makes a good Pokémon team in this simplified version of Pokémon. Since it's not specified, I can assume that each Pokémon has strengths and weaknesses based on their types and moves. The goal is to create a balanced team that can effectively counter the opposing team.

Looking at the previous team, they used indices 14 (Water), 30 (Bug), and 49 (Steel). Let me check what each of these Pokémon are like:

- **PkmTemplate 14**: Type Water, Max HP 64, Moves include Flying, Priority 1, Change Type, etc. So it's a Water-type with some good moves.
- **PkmTemplate 30**: Type Bug, Max HP 74, Ground type moves and high Power. This looks like a solid Bug-type Pokémon.
- **PkmTemplate 49**: Type Steel, Max HP 116, Moves include Ice, Priority 1, etc. So a strong Steel-type.

Now, the team lost last time, so maybe their composition wasn't optimal against whatever they faced. To win next time, I need to ensure each Pokémon is effective and not redundant.

Looking at the Roster, there are many types: Water, Bug, Steel, etc. I should consider what types complement each other. For example, having a Fire-type might be good if the last opponent was Water, but without knowing that, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe adding a strong attacker or one with defensive moves.

I notice that index 30 is Bug, which can be weak against Ground and strong against Grass and others. Index 14 is Water, which is weak against Ground and strong against Fire and Water types. Index 49 is Steel, which is strong against Ice, Rock, etc., but weak against Ice and others.

Perhaps adding another type that covers a weakness or adds more versatility. Looking at the available Pokémon, maybe someone with a strong all-around type could help. For example, index 17 is Psychic/Ice, which has good moves including Poison and Protect, making it versatile.

Alternatively, perhaps replacing one of the current members with a better fit. Let me check other indices:

- **Index 12**: Ground, Max HP 115. Ground can support Bug and others but might be redundant if there's already a Bug.
- **Index 19**: Normal/ Fairy, which could provide some versatility with different types. Or maybe index 26: Dark/Normal, which has good moves like Trickroom.

Wait, the last result was a loss, so perhaps their team composition was too weak. Maybe they need stronger or more complementary Pokémon.

Looking at the Roster again, I see that index 17 (Psychic/Ice) has high Max HP and useful moves like Protect and Poison. This could make the team more resilient.

Alternatively, index 30 is Bug, which is good against Grass, but if the opponent had Grass, maybe having a Fire or Electric would be better.

But without knowing the exact opposing types, it's tricky. So perhaps choosing Pokémon that can handle multiple types effectively and have strong moves.

Another approach is to look for high Max HP and strong moves. For example, index 17 has Max HP 158, which is quite high, making it harder to defeat. Plus, having a Protect move could help in protecting weaker teammates.

Alternatively, index 26 (Dark/Normal) has some good moves like Trickroom and Ignore Evasion, which can be useful in certain battles.

But considering the previous team was [14,30,49], maybe replacing one of them with someone who complements their strengths or covers a weakness. For example, if the current team is weak against Ground (since Bug is weak against it), adding a Ghost or Rock type could help counter that.

Looking at index 35: Grass/Normal. Maybe not the best for defending against Ground. Index 33: Ghost/Rock. That would add both, which can help against Ground and Rock moves. So maybe replacing one of the current members with 33.

Alternatively, adding someone like index 17 to boost team strength.

But the user wants exactly three indices, so I need to choose from Roster. The previous team was [14,30,49]. Let me see what each offers:

- 14: Water
- 30: Bug
- 49: Steel

To maximize effectiveness, perhaps replacing one of them with a more versatile or strong Pokémon.

Looking at index 17: Psychic/Ice. It has Protect and other good moves, which could help in protecting the team. So maybe replace 49 (Steel) with 17.

Alternatively, adding someone like 26 (Dark/Normal) for Trickroom and Ignore Evasion.

But without knowing the exact opponent's types, it's hard to say. However, since the last result was a loss, perhaps the user wants a stronger team.

Another consideration is the moves each Pokémon has. For example, index 30 has Ground moves, which can be good against opponents with certain types. Index 14 has Water, which can be strong against Fire and others. Index 49 has Steel, which is strong against Ice and Rock.

Perhaps adding someone who can cover a weakness or provide an additional type that's not yet covered. For example, if the team lacks a strong Electric or Fire type, adding one could help.

Looking at index 17 (Psychic/Ice), it doesn't add a new type but has strong moves. Index 26 (Dark/Normal) adds Dark and Normal, which can be useful for coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps replacing the weakest member of the previous team with someone stronger.

But how to determine who is the weakest? Max HP might be a factor, but each Pokémon's effectiveness depends on their moves too.

Index 14: Water, HP 64
Index 30: Bug, HP 74
Index 49: Steel, HP 116

So index 49 has the highest HP. Maybe keeping that one is good for tanking attacks. Then, perhaps replacing another member with a stronger one.

Looking at other strong candidates:

- Index 17: Max HP 158
- Index 26: Max HP 119
- Index 35: Max HP 112

So they are all higher than the current team's max HP, which was 116. So replacing a lower HP Pokémon with a higher one could improve the team.

Therefore, perhaps replace index 14 (HP 64) with someone like index 17 (HP 158). Or maybe replace index 30 (74) with index 26 (119).

Alternatively, looking at who can cover more types or provide better moves.

Another angle: each Pokémon's type coverage. The current team has Water, Bug, Steel. Adding a Fire or Electric could help against Grass or Water opponents, respectively.

Looking for a Fire-type in the Roster:

- Index 10: Fire
- Index 11: Bug/ Poison
- Index 19: Normal/Fairy
- Index 21: Fire/Fairy

So index 10 is pure Fire. Adding this could provide better coverage against Grass and Water opponents.

Alternatively, index 18: Electric/Fight, which can handle Fire and others.

But without knowing the opponent's type strengths, it's a bit of a gamble. However, since the last result was a loss, perhaps adding a strong attacker would help.

In that case, maybe replace one of the current members with a stronger Fire or Electric type.

So, for example, replacing index 30 (Bug) with index 10 (Fire). Then the team would be [14, 10, 49].

But I'm not sure if that's better than other options. Alternatively, adding someone like 17 for their high HP and good moves.

Another consideration: Max PP (Max Points in a move). Higher PP means more uses, which can be helpful in longer battles or against multiple opponents.

Looking at index 30: Bug has some moves with Max PP 13, which is decent. Index 14: Water also has some higher PP.

But again, without knowing the exact battle conditions, it's hard to say.

In conclusion, considering the previous team lost, and looking for a stronger or more versatile team, replacing one of the lower HP members with someone like index 17 (HP 158) or another strong candidate might be the best approach.

Alright, I need to help this user select a new Pokémon team based on their last loss and previous performance. Let's break down what they provided.

First, the user mentioned that their last team lost, and their Elo is now 1184.75. They had two winning teams in the past: [0,1,2] twice. So, the indices 0,1,2 have been successful before.

Looking at the current Roster, there are 49 Pokémon templates. The previous team used indices [14,30,49]. I need to figure out if these were good choices and what could be better now.

I should consider each Pokémon's type, max HP, and moves. Since the last team lost, maybe their types or moves weren't effective against the opponents they faced. Also, considering that the user wants to maximize their chances next time, I should look for Pokémon with high Max HP, strong moves, and complementary types.

Let me go through each index:

- 14: Water type, good moves including Flying and Fairy. Seems solid.
- 30: Bug type, which can be useful against Grass and Ground types. Good moves like Ground and Steel.
- 49: Steel type, which is a good defensive and offensive type with moves like Ice and Protect.

The previous team used these indices, but maybe the specific Pokémon in those templates didn't perform well last time. So, I should look for similar or better options.

Looking at other indices:

0: Water/Fairy – strong, but maybe not as effective as others.
1: Fight/Ice – good moves like Psychic and Fairy.
2: Grass/Electric – has Rock and Electric which are good defensive types.
3: Poison – can be a bit weak against certain types.
4: Bug – useful for Grass and Ground.
5: Fight – similar to index 1.
6: Rock – strong, but maybe not the best if they need more versatility.
7: Bug/Dark – could complement a team with their moves.
8: Dark/Fight – good mix of dark and fight moves.
9: Flying – useful for sweeping through opponents.
10: Fire – might not be as effective against the last opponent's type.
11: Bug/Poison – good for status moves.
12: Ground – strong defensive type.
13: Grass – has Dragon and Ice, which are good.
14: Water – same as index 0 but different template. Good.
15: Ghost – useful for Water and Rock.
16: Ghost – similar to 15.
17: Psychic/Ice – has good moves like Poison and Water.
18: Electric/Fight – strong offensive moves.
19: Normal – can be useful as a flexible type.
20: Normal/Fairy – has Fairy which is good.
21: Fire/Fairy – mix of fire and fairy, which could be strong.
22: Ground – same as index12.
23: Bug – similar to 4.
24: Normal – versatile.
25: Water – same as others.
26: Dark/Normal – useful for status and normal.
27: Fairy/Dark – strong with Rock and Ice.
28: Bug – same as 4.
29: Rock/Ghost – can be good against Ghost types.
30: Bug – same as others.
31: Dark/Poison – good for status and poison moves.
32: Electric/Normal – versatile with Rock and Flying.
33: Ghost/Rock – useful against Water and Electric.
34: Poison/Fairy – mix of fairy and poison, which is strong.
35: Grass/Normal – can handle grass and normal types.
36: Fairy/Poison – similar to 34.
37: Fairy/Fire – fire and fairy combination.
38: Poison/Grass – good against grass and poison.
39: Rock/Dragon – great for dragon moves.
40: Flying – same as index9.
41: Dark/Fairy – mix of dark and fairy.
42: Steel – strong defensive type.
43: Dark/Ground – useful for ground and dark.
44: Fight/Fire – similar to index5.
45: Water – same as others.
46: Rock/Fairy – good with rock and fairy.
47: Dragon/Steel – excellent for dragon moves.
48: Water – same as others.
49: Steel – same as others.

Now, considering the previous success of indices 0,1,2, which are Water/Fairy, Fight/Ice, Grass/Electric. So, those types might have been effective before. But since they lost last time, maybe their specific templates weren't optimal.

I should look for Pokémon that can cover multiple types effectively, have strong moves like STAB (same type attack boost), high accuracy, and good PP to survive battles.

Looking at indices 7 (Bug/Dark) and 31 (Dark/POISON): Dark is a versatile type with good offensive options. Both have strong moves, which could be beneficial.

Index 37 (Fairy/Fire) combines Fairy and Fire, which can be strong against Grass and Water types. The moves include Rock and Max PP 12, which are useful for switching and dealing damage.

Index 32 (Electric/Normal): Electric is good for switching with Rock and Flying, while Normal is versatile. This combination could provide a mix of offensive and defensive capabilities.

Alternatively, indices like 49 (Steel) can be great for defense and have strong moves like Protect and Steel which can block attacks.

But since the user's last team lost, maybe they need more offensive power or better coverage. So, choosing types that can handle various opponents is key.

Another option is index 39 (Rock/DRAGON): Rock provides good defense and STAB, while Dragon adds powerful moves like Thunderbolt and Outrage.

Similarly, indices like 46 (Rock/Fairy) combine fairy for healing and status and rock for defense. It could be a strong choice.

After evaluating, I think using indices that cover multiple types with strong moves would maximize their chances. So, selecting three Pokémon that can handle different aspects of the battlefield: offense, defense, and status.

Okay, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their previous performance and the provided roster. Let me break down what they've given.

First, the user's last battle was successful; their Elo is now 1198.43. Their previous team used indices [7, 31, 37]. So, I should consider which Pokémon from these indices performed well and might complement a new team.

Looking at each index:

- Index 7: Type is BUG/DARK. The user might appreciate the versatility of Bug or Dark types, which can cover multiple defensive and offensive roles.
- Index 31: Type is DARK/POISON. This is great for both offense and defense, as Poison can be really effective against a variety of foes.
- Index 37: Type is FAIRY/FIRE. Fire can be strong against Water and Ice types, while Fairy offers good defensive coverage.

So the previous team had a mix of Dark, Poison, and Fairy/Fire. To maintain balance, I should probably include similar types but maybe adjust for any weaknesses or strengths they might have faced before.

Looking at the current roster, I need to pick three Pokémon that can synergize well. Let's see which types could work together effectively.

1. Type coverage: Maybe include a Rock type for Ground and Water resistance, a Fire type for offensive boost, and a Dark type for versatility.
2. Checking each index again:
   - Index 14: WATER. Could be good against Fire types but might struggle against Grass or Electric. But having a Water type could help in the next battle if the opponent has Water-weak Pokémon.
   - Index 30: BUG. Good all-rounder, can handle both offense and defense.
   - Index 49: STEEL. Provides strong defense against many types and can switch between different resistances.

Putting it together, these three indices (14, 30, 49) seem to cover Water, Bug, and Steel, which should be a balanced team for the next battle. The user's last success might suggest they handle certain types well, so keeping similar strategies could help maintain their streak.

Okay, so I need to help choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The user provided a lot of data about the Roster, which includes various Pokémon with their types, max HP, and moves. They also mentioned that the last team won, so I should probably look for strategies that worked before.

First, let me understand what's been used in the past. The previous team indices were [14, 30, 49]. Looking at those:

- Index 14: Type is WATER.
- Index 30: Type is BUG.
- Index 49: Type is STEEL.

So last time, they used Water, Bug, and Steel types. Those are all good defensive and offensive types that can cover each other's weaknesses. Now, I need to think about what would be a strong team this time.

Since the last result was a win, maybe sticking with similar strategies would work. Let me look at the current Roster again.

I remember that in Pokémon battles, having a balance of offense and defense is key. Maybe using types that can cover each other's weaknesses and have good moves like priority or status effects.

Looking at the available indices:

14: Type WATER. It's good for support with moves like heals or boosts.
30: Type BUG. Good against grass and poison, with moves like bug bite which are strong.
49: Type STEEL. Strong against ice and rock, with moves like steel-cage which can block attacks.

Wait, but in the Roster, index 14 is a Water type with moves that include healing and status changes, which could be really useful for support.

Index 30: Bug type, with good moves like bug bite and web. It's also good against grass and poison, so it can help control the field.

Index 49: Steel type, which is strong against ice and rock. Plus, moves like steel-cage provide physical defense.

So maybe keeping these types could be beneficial again. But perhaps there are better choices that can enhance the team further.

Looking at other indices:

7: Bug/Dark. Maybe a good attacker with dark moves.
17: Psychic/Ice. Could add a strong special attacker with ice moves.
26: Dark/Normal. Good for status and normal attacks.

But considering the last team won, maybe sticking with similar types is safer. But I also need to check which Pokémon have good move sets that can contribute effectively.

For example, index 14's Water Pokémon has heals and status moves, which are great for keeping the team alive and applying status effects. Index 30's Bug Pokémon can set up web traps or use bug bite for damage. Index 49's Steel Pokémon can block physical attacks with steel cage and have strong physical moves.

Alternatively, maybe replacing one of them with a more powerful attacker or another support could improve the team.

Looking at index 17: Type is Psychic/Ice. It has moves like psycho cut which is strong and accurate. Also, ice moves can be good for dealing damage from a distance and setting up terrain.

Index 26: Dark/Normal. Dark types are good against fairy and ice, and normal types cover a wide range of effectiveness. Plus, dark moves can include things like shadow force, which confuse enemies.

But I'm not sure if these replacements would improve the team's overall effectiveness compared to the previous choices.

Another thought is about the moves each Pokémon has. For example, index 30's Bug has web and bug bite, which are both strong. Index 49's Steel has steel cage and high physical attack moves. So maybe keeping them is good because their moves complement each other.

Also, considering that the last team won, they might have used similar strategies, so continuing with a tried-and-true combination could be safer.

I should also think about the types' weaknesses and strengths to ensure coverage. Water resists fire and grass; Bug resists ground and poison; Steel resists rock and ice. So together, they cover a lot of types and have good defensive properties.

If I were to replace one, perhaps with a type that covers another weakness, like electric or fairy. But looking at the roster, I don't see any indices that would add significant coverage beyond what's already there.

Therefore, maybe keeping the same indices is the best choice to maintain the team's effectiveness.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The last battle was won by a team with indices [14, 30, 49], and my Elo is now 1229.45. My goal is to pick three different Pokémon from the provided roster that will give me the best chance of winning the next match.

First, I need to understand what factors determine a good Pokémon for a battle. Typically, higher Max_HP means better survivability. Moves with high Power and Accuracy are also crucial because they can take down opponents effectively. Additionally, considering Type advantages or resistances can be important depending on the opponent's types.

Looking at the previous winning team, indices 14, 30, and 49. Let me check what those Pokémon are:

- Index 14: Type WATER, Max_HP=64, Moves include FLYING, FAIRY, etc.
- Index 30: Type BUG, Max_HP=74, with Ground and Steel moves.
- Index 49: Type STEEL, Max_HP=116, with Ice, Flying, etc.

So the previous team had a mix of types that probably covered each other's weaknesses. Now I need to find three Pokémon that can complement each other in terms of types and moves.

Looking at the Roster:

I see several types like Water, Bug, Steel, Rock, Ghost, etc. Maybe choosing a similar mix as before would be effective. Let's consider their moveset, focusing on high Power and Accuracy moves.

Starting with Type coverage: If I pick a Water-type, it can cover itself and maybe pair well with others. Bug is good against Ground and Grass. Steel is strong against Rock and Ice. Alternatively, Fire is strong against Grass and Ice.

Wait, but in the previous team, 14 was Water, 30 was Bug, 49 was Steel. So they covered different types: Water vs Bug and Steel. Maybe I can try to find similar coverage or see what's missing.

Looking at other indices:

Index 7: Bug/Dark with good moves.
Index 20: Normal/Fairy with high Max_HP.
Index 22: Ground with strong physical moves.
Index 26: Dark/Normal, which could pair well with others.
Index 35: Grass/Normal, good against Ice and Water maybe.

I need to pick three that can cover different types or have strong individual moves. Let's see:

If I choose Type Bug, it's good against Ground and Grass. Type Steel is good against Rock and Ice. Type Electric is good against Water and Ground. Alternatively, Fire is strong against Grass and Ice.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon with high Max_HP and strong moves. For example, index 20 has Normal/Fairy with Max HP 160, which is quite high. That could be a tankier option. Index 37: Fairy/Fire with 157 HP, which also sounds strong.

Wait, but maybe I should focus on the previous team's types. The last team had Water, Bug, and Steel. So perhaps sticking to similar type coverage would be good. Let me look for other Water, Bug, or Steel Pokémon that might complement them.

Looking at index 14: already used. Maybe another Steel-type, like index 49 is already used. So perhaps another BUG or WATER? Or maybe a different combination.

Alternatively, if I want to avoid using the same types as before, maybe mix in some others, but it's risky because the opponent might have counters.

Wait, but without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to tailor specifically. So the best approach is usually to maximize individual Pokémon strengths and coverage.

Let me look for high Max_HP:

- Index 20: 160 HP
- Index 36: 146 HP
- Index 37: 157 HP
- Index 38: 160 HP

These are the higher ones. Maybe choosing among these could give good survivability.

Looking at their movesets, I need to ensure they have strong offensive moves as well. For example, index 20 has Self Switch and Trickroom, which can be useful but maybe not the most offensive.

Index 37: Fairy/Fire with high Power on some moves. That might be good for taking down opponents.

Index 38: Poison/Grass with Ground and Bug moves. That could help against various types.

Alternatively, index 26: Dark/Normal with Normal and Dark moves. Those can cover a lot of types as well.

Wait, let me think about the previous team's moves:

- Index14 (Water): Good at switching type, which is useful.
- Index30 (Bug): Ground moves are strong.
- Index49 (Steel): Can handle Ice and Flying, plus Protect.

So maybe I can pick a similar structure: one that can switch types, another with good physical moves, and a third with coverage against multiple types.

Looking at index 7: Bug/Dark. Has GROUND and BUG moves, which can take down Grass and Ground opponents. Also has a Protect move, which is useful.

Index 35: Grass/Normal. Good against Water and Ice, with Protect and Ice moves. That could complement the previous team's coverage.

Index 45: Water with Stealth Rock, which is good for controlling the field.

Alternatively, index14 is already used. Maybe pick another Bug or Steel.

Wait, but I can't use indices that were used before unless they're necessary. But the problem doesn't specify avoiding them; it just says to choose three from the roster. So maybe it's fine to include any as long as they are effective.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to look for the next best in terms of Power and Accuracy.

Looking at index 20: Normal/Fairy with high PP. It has moves like Trickroom, Self Switch, which can set up the field.

Index 37: Fairy/Fire with high Power on some moves, like Power 140 on Fairy move.

Index 38: Poison/Grass with Ground and Bug moves, which can take down Grass and Ground opponents.

Alternatively, index 26: Dark/Normal. Has Normal and Dark moves, which are versatile.

I think a combination of high HP, strong types, and good moves is key. Let me try to pick three that together cover multiple types and have strong offensive options.

Maybe:

- Index 20: Normal/Fairy with Self Switch and Trickroom.
- Index 37: Fairy/Fire with strong Fairy and Fire moves.
- Index 38: Poison/Grass with Ground and Bug moves.

This gives a mix of Fairy, Normal, Grass, Fire, and Poison types. It also includes some good defensive moves like Self Switch and Protect.

Alternatively, another combination could be:

- Index 26: Dark/Normal
- Index 35: Grass/Normal
- Index 40: Flying with Steel and Ground moves.

But I'm not sure if that's better than the previous idea.

Wait, maybe considering index 7 (Bug/Dark), which has strong Ground moves and a Protect. Pairing it with index 30 (BUG) is already used, but since we can choose any, maybe another Bug or Dark Pokémon.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on higher Max_HP:

- Index20:160 HP
- Index37:157 HP
- Index38:160 HP

These three have the highest HP. Their movesets are:

20: Normal/Fairy with Self Switch and Trickroom.
37: Fairy/Fire with strong Fairy moves.
38: Poison/Grass with Ground, Bug, and Protect.

This seems like a solid team. They cover multiple types, have high HP, and some good defensive and offensive moves.

Alternatively, if I want more offensive power:

- Index37's Fire/Fairy could take down Grass and Ice effectively.
- Index20 can set up the field with Trickroom or Self Switch.
- Index38 can handle Ground and Bug opponents.

I think this team would be strong. Now, let me check if these indices are unique: 20,37,38. Yes, no overlaps.

Another consideration is whether any of them have moves that could counter each other's weaknesses. For example, index20 has Self Switch which could help in team composition.

In conclusion, after evaluating the types, Max_HP, and move sets, I believe indices 20, 37, and 38 would form a strong team.

Okay, I need to help the user choose a new Pokémon team based on their previous performance and the given roster. Let me break down what's provided.

First, the user won their last battle with an Elo of 1246.96. Their previous team used indices [20, 37, 38]. Now, they need to select three new Pokémon from the roster to maximize their chances in the next match.

I should consider each of the provided templates and analyze their strengths. Since the user won last time, they probably want to maintain or improve their team's effectiveness without necessarily sticking to the same types unless those were effective before.

Looking at the previous team:
- Index 20: Type NORMAL/FAIRY with high Max_HP (160) and good moves.
- Index 37: FAIRY/FIRE, also strong with 157 HP.
- Index 38: POISON/GRASS, versatile and tough.

Now, I need to see what the roster offers. The user's last team was a mix of Normal/Fairy, Fairy/Fire, and Poison/Grass. Maybe they want similar types for consistency or different types to counter new opponents.

I should look for strong, versatile Pokémon with high HP and good moves that can adapt to various situations. High Max_PP (PP is PP, probably a typo for PP, which stands for Power Points) indicates strong moves. Also, checking if moves are physical or special could help in matchup planning.

Looking through the roster:

- Index 20: Type NORMAL/FAIRY, HP 160, good stats.
- Index 37: FAIRY/FIRE, HP 157, great stats.
- Index 38: POISON/GRASS, HP 160, versatile.

Other options might include other Fairy types for synergy or different typings to cover more types. For example, Grass and Poison are both in the previous team, so maybe adding another type like Water or Electric could be beneficial.

But since the user's last team won with those indices, perhaps sticking close to similar strengths would be wise unless there's a clear better option.

I should also consider the movesets. High accuracy, strong physical/special attacks, and useful moves like Self Switch or Trickroom can be really powerful in battles.

Looking at the current roster, some Pokémon have great stats and move sets that could complement each other. For example, index 20 has a high Max_HP and strong moves. Index 37 is also very strong with both Fairy and Fire. Index 38 provides Poison and Grass coverage, which are good for versatility.

I should ensure that the selected team isn't too type-locked. Having a mix of types can help against different opponents. For example, having multiple types like Fairy, Fire, and Grass gives coverage against various typings.

In conclusion, since the previous team won with indices 20, 37, and 38, it's logical to stick with similar strong Pokémon unless there's a clear better combination. So, I think those three should be chosen again.

Alright, so I'm trying to help someone create a Pokémon team for their game. They mentioned it's a simplified version of Pokémon, and they need to choose three Pokémon from the given roster based on certain criteria. Let me break down what I know.

First, the user provided a lot of data about each Pokémon, including their types, max HP, moves, etc. The task is to select exactly three indices from this list, formatted as ---i1, i2, i3---, without any extra text or explanations. They mentioned that they want to maximize their chances in the next battle.

The previous message indicated it's their first battle, with no prior results. So, I'm assuming they need a strong team to start with. They also provided some context about how previous selections were made based on certain attributes like attack power, accuracy, and moves that can boost effectiveness or provide defensive advantages.

Looking at the roster, each Pokémon has different types, stats, and moves. To maximize their chances, I should focus on selecting Pokémon that have strong offensive capabilities, good defense, and versatile moves that can handle various situations in a battle. Since it's their first time, they might not have any existing team, so starting with high HP and powerful moves would be beneficial.

I'll need to look for Pokémon with high max HP, strong attacking moves, and maybe some defensive moves or boosts that can help them in battles. Also, considering type advantages could be important if the opponent's type is known, but since it's the first battle, maybe versatility is more crucial.

Let me go through each Pokémon's data:

- PkmTemplate 0: Ghost/Fire with decent HP and a variety of moves, including Poison and Misty Terrain.
- PkmTemplate 1: Ghost with good attack and accuracy but lower HP.
- PkmTemplate 2: Dark with high max HP and strong physical attacks.
- PkmTemplate 3: Ground/Electric with low HP but useful moves like Rock and Sun boost.
- PkmTemplate 4: Water with decent stats and some boosting moves, but lower HP.
- PkmTemplate 5: Ground/Poison with high HP and strong physical moves.
- PkmTemplate 6: Fire with very high max HP and powerful moves like Psycho-C if needed.
- ... (continuing this process for all 49 templates).

I need to pick three that can complement each other. Maybe a Ghost/Fire type for versatility, a Dark or Ground type for strong physical attacks, and perhaps a Water or Electric type for added effectiveness in certain terrain.

Looking at indices 5, 6, and maybe 14: PkmTemplate 5 is Ground/Poison with high HP and good moves. PkmTemplate 6 is Fire with the highest max HP I see (154). PkmTemplate 14 is Electric/Ground with decent stats but some good moves like Grass and Electric.

Alternatively, considering that they might need a mix of types to cover different weaknesses, perhaps choosing a Ghost/Fire, a Dark type, and a Water type could be effective. For example, indices 0 (Ghost/Fire), 2 (Dark), and 4 (Water).

But I also need to think about the moves each Pokémon has. High accuracy, powerful attacks, and multi-type coverage can be really useful. PkmTemplate 6 has Psycho-C which is a strong special move. PkmTemplate 5 has physical attacks with high PP. Maybe combining these with another strong attacker.

Wait, maybe PkmTemplate 49: Dragon/Ground with high HP and good moves like Psycho-C, but I'm not sure if that's better than others.

I think it's also important to consider the previous team they used. The user mentioned the last result was their first battle, so no prior Elo changes. But since it's their first time, maybe starting with a strong team to build a good foundation for future battles.

In summary, I need to pick three Pokémon that have high max HP, powerful moves, and types that can complement each other or cover different aspects of battle.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, the user mentioned that their last team won, and their Elo is now 1215.00. The previous team that won consisted of indices [5, 6, 49]. So I should consider these as part of the context for forming a new team.

Next, looking at the Roster, there are 50 Pokémon templates, each with Type, Max_HP, and Moves. My task is to select three of them in such a way that they maximize the chances of winning the next battle.

I think I should start by analyzing what worked well in the previous successful team. The indices 5, 6, and 49 were part of a winning combination. Let me check what each of these Pokémon are:

- Index 5: Type is GROUND/POISON, Max_HP=136, Moves include Grass, Electric, etc.
- Index 6: Type is FIRE, Max_HP=154, with moves like Psychic, Fire, etc.
- Index 49: Type DRAGON/GROUND, Max_HP=141, with Psychic, Dark, and Ground moves.

Looking at these types, the team had a mix of Ground, Fire, and Dragon. Ground is good for physical attacks and coverage, Fire can be strong against Grass and Ice, and Dragon adds versatility with Psychic moves and resistances.

Now, I need to think about the strengths of each type and how they complement each other. Maybe adding another type that covers gaps or synergizes well could be beneficial. For example, if the opponent has certain types, having coverage against them would help.

Looking at the Roster again, I should consider which Pokémon might complement the existing types. Let's see:

- Type GRASS: Good against Fire and Water. Maybe adding a Grass type for coverage.
- Type WATER: Useful against Dragon and Grass.
- Type ELECTRIC: Good against Ground, which is already covered.

Wait, but the user's last team included a FIRE and Ground Pokémon (indices 6 and 5). So if I add a Water or Grass type, it might provide additional coverage. Alternatively, maybe adding an Electric type could help with Ground resistance.

Looking for high HP and strong moves, let me check some indices:

- Index 14: Type ELECTRIC/GROUND. Max_HP=84. Moves include Grass, Electric, etc.
- Index 30: Type STEEL, Max_HP=97, with Water and Ghost moves.
- Index 49: Already in the team.

Another consideration is the effectiveness of each Pokémon's moves against others. For example, a Fire type can be useful for taking out Grass opponents, while a Ground type can handle Electric or Rock types.

I also need to ensure that the new team isn't redundant and covers multiple types effectively. Maybe including a Electric/Ground, a Fire, and another strong Dragon type could work well.

Looking at index 14: ELECTRIC/GROUND. It has moves like Grass, which would be good against the opponent's Grass if they have any. Also, Electric can cover against Ground.

Index 30 is STEEL, which can help with resistances and has Water moves, which might be useful for opposing Dragon or Ice types.

So putting it together, the new team could be [5 (Ground/POISON), 6 (FIRE), 14 (ELECTRIC/GROUND)]. Wait, but I need to check if these are the best choices.

Alternatively, maybe index 30 is better than 14 because Steel can cover more resistances. Let me think:

- Index 30: STEEL, which has good resistances and some strong moves.
- Index 6: FIRE for offensive capability against Grass and Ice.
- Index 5: GROUND/POISON for physical attacks and coverage.

So the team would be [5, 6, 30]. This gives a mix of Fire, Ground, and Steel. Fire can cover against Grass and Water, Ground covers Electric and Rock, and Steel provides resistance to many types.

Alternatively, if the opponent is using Dragon or Ice types, having a Water type could help, but I don't see a strong Water option in the top picks.

Wait, another option could be index 49 (Dragon/Ground) instead of 5. But since 5 is already included, maybe not necessary.

I think [5, 6, 30] makes sense because:

- 5: Ground/POISON can handle Electric and Rock opponents.
- 6: FIRE can take out Grass and Water types effectively.
- 30: STEEL provides resistance to many types and can handle Ice or Dragon opponents.

This combination should be balanced and cover multiple types, giving a good chance of winning the next battle.

Okay, so I need to choose a new Pokémon team from the given roster to maximize my chances of winning the next battle. The previous team won and had indices [5, 6, 14]. Let's think about this step by step.

First, I should look at what types were used in the last successful team. Indices 5, 6, and 14 correspond to Pokémon 5, 6, and 14. Let me check their types:

- Pokémon 5: Type GROUND/POISON
- Pokémon 6: Type FIRE
- Pokémon 14: Type ELECTRIC/GROUND

So the previous team had Ground, Fire, and Electric/Ground types. That's a mix of Ground, Fire, and Electric. Ground is versatile because it resists many types, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach now.

Next, I need to evaluate each Pokémon in the roster and see which ones would complement each other or counter potential opponents effectively. Since I don't know the exact types of the opponents, I should aim for a balanced team with coverage against common types or strong offensive options.

Looking at the current roster, there are many options. Let me highlight some that might be good:

- Pokémon 30: Type STEEL. Steel is strong against Rock and Ice, which could help in certain matchups.
- Pokémon 14: Type ELECTRIC/GROUND (already used). Maybe I can include another Ground type for coverage.
- Pokémon 49: Type DRAGON/GROUND. Dragon has great special moves, and Ground provides good defense.

Wait, but the user wants a new team of three. The previous indices were [5,6,14]. So I need to exclude these and pick three others.

Let me consider each possible combination:

Option 1: Pokémon 30 (Steel), 49 (Dragon/Ground), and another strong type like Ice or Fire. But looking at the types, maybe adding a Ghost type could be useful for coverage against certain opponents.

Wait, perhaps I should look for types that are effective against others. For example, Ground resists Grass, Fire, etc., so adding more Grounds might not always be ideal unless it's necessary. Alternatively, having a mix of types that can cover each other's weaknesses.

Alternatively, considering the previous successful team used Ground, Fire, and Electric, maybe sticking with similar strategies but picking Pokémon that have strong moves or higher Max HP for better survivability.

Looking at the moves:

- Pokémon 30: STEEL has high accuracy and good PP. It could be a solid choice.
- Pokémon 49: DRAGON/GROUND. Dragon is great for special attacks, which can be powerful against Ice types.
- Maybe add another type like Water or Ice to cover more bases.

Alternatively, let's think about the previous team's strengths. They won last time, so perhaps keeping some similar strategies would help. But without knowing the exact opponents, it's hard to say.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon with high Max HP and strong moves. For example, Pokémon 30 has a Max HP of 97, which is decent, but maybe others have higher.

Wait, let me check the Max HP:

- Pokémon 5: 136
- Pokémon 6: 154
- Pokémon 14: 84
So the previous team had high HP.

Looking at others, Pokémon 30 has 97, which is lower. Maybe it's not the best for survivability. Perhaps I should pick higher HP ones.

Wait, but without knowing the opponents' moves or types, it's hard to prioritize HP over other stats like attack power or accuracy.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on having a mix of types that can cover each other. For example, Ground covers Electric and Fire, so if I have Ground and Electric, that could be useful. But in this case, the previous team already included Electric/Ground (14), so maybe adding another type like Steel for coverage against Rock or Ice.

Wait, but the user wants to avoid including the same types unless necessary. So perhaps it's better to have a varied team with different strengths.

Let me list the possible candidates again:

- Pokémon 30: Type Steel, Max HP 97
- Pokémon 49: Type Dragon/Ground, Max HP 141
- Maybe add a Ghost type for coverage against Psychic and others.

Looking at Ghost types, Pokémon 0 is Ghost/Fire, but it's already used? Wait no, the previous team was [5,6,14], so indices 5,6,14. So I can use other indices like 30,49, etc.

Wait, let me see: the user wants to choose a new team from the roster, not necessarily excluding any types, just as long as it's three different indices.

So perhaps the best approach is to select Pokémon with high Max HP and strong moves. Let's look for those:

- Pokémon 14: ELECTRIC/GROUND, HP84
- Pokémon 6: FIRE, HP154 (highest HP)
- Pokémon 5: GROUND/POISON, HP136

But since I need three different indices, not including the previous ones.

Wait, no: the previous team was [5,6,14], so in the new team, I cannot include these indices. So I have to pick from 0,1,2,...49 except 5,6,14.

So among the remaining, let's look for high HP and strong moves.

Looking at the data:

- Pokémon 30: Type Steel, Max HP97
- Pokémon 31: Ground/Electric, Max HP85
- Pokémon 32: Bug/Grass, Max HP135 (high)
- Pokémon 33: Water/Poison, Max HP104
- Pokémon 34: Dark/Fight, Max HP135
- Pokémon 35: Psychic/Ghost, Max HP128
- Pokémon 36: Flying/Ground, Max HP113
- Pokémon 37: Fight, Max HP87
- Pokémon 38: Normal, Max HP76
- Pokémon 39: Normal/Fire, Max HP136 (high)
- Pokémon 40: Steel/Ground, Max HP151 (highest in the list)
- Pokémon 41: Grass/ Flying, Max HP115
- Pokémon 42: Rock, Max HP97
- Pokémon 43: Bug, Max HP95
- Pokémon 44: Flying/Ground, Max HP117
- Pokémon 45: Dark, Max HP147
- Pokémon 46: Dark, Max HP102
- Pokémon 47: Ghost/Ground, Max HP99
- Pokémon 48: Fight, Max HP119
- Pokémon 49: Dragon/Ground, Max HP141

So the highest HP is Pokémon 40 with 151 and Pokémon 39 with 136. Then Pokémon 32 and 34 have 135.

But maybe it's better to balance HP with strong moves. For example, Pokémon 30 has Steel type which is resilient against Rock and Ice, and can learn various useful moves.

Alternatively, Pokémon 49: Dragon/Ground. Ground resists many types, and Dragon has great special attacks.

Wait, but I need three Pokémon. Let me think about their types:

If I pick:

- Pokémon 40: Type Steel/Ground. That's a good mix of both.
- Pokémon 49: Type Dragon/Ground. This adds another Ground type and Dragon moves.
- Then perhaps add a Fire or Water type for coverage.

Looking at the remaining indices, perhaps Pokémon 6 is already used, so maybe choose another Fire type? Wait, no, I can't use index 6 again.

Wait, but let me check if there are other good Fire types. Looking through:

- Pokémon 19: Type Fire, Max HP150
- Pokémon 29: Type Fire, Max HP136
So perhaps include one of these for Fire.

But considering the previous team had a Fire type (index 6), maybe it's better to avoid too much overlap in case the opponents have strengths against that type.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a Water or Ice type would be beneficial. For example:

- Pokémon 40: Steel/Ground
- Pokémon 49: Dragon/Ground
- Pokémon 44: Water/... Wait, no, Pokémon 44 is Flying/Ground.

Wait, let me think again. The previous team had Ground, Fire (from index6), and Electric/Ground (index14).

So the opponent may have weakness against that combination. But in any case, I need to pick three new indices.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing Pokémon 40,32,49 for types Steel/Ground, Bug/Grass, Dragon/Ground. That's a mix of different types, which can be effective against various opponents.

But let me analyze their stats:

- Pokémon40: Type Steel/Ground, HP151, moves including Steel and Ground abilities.
- Pokémon32: Type Bug/Grass, HP135, with strong Grass and Bug moves.
- Pokémon49: Type Dragon/Ground, HP141, with powerful Dragon moves.

This could be a strong team. Alternatively, maybe add a Fire type for coverage.

Alternatively, considering the previous success, perhaps sticking with Ground types is good because they can cover multiple weaknesses.

Wait, but each move's effectiveness depends on their types and the opponent's types. It's complicated, but in the absence of more specific info, the best approach is to pick high HP Pokémon with strong moves that cover multiple types.

So let me list the top candidates:

- 40: Steel/Ground, Max PP151
- 49: Dragon/Ground, Max PP141
- 32: Bug/Grass, Max PP135

Alternatively, maybe include a Fire type for coverage. But I have to choose three indices not including 5,6,14.

Another thought: the previous team had [5,6,14], which were Ground/ Poison (index5), Fire (index6), Electric/Ground (index14). So their types were Ground, Fire, and Ground/Electric.

If the next opponent has weaknesses against these types, perhaps adding a Water or Ice type could help because they are not in the previous team. But without knowing the exact opponent's types, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing a mix of types that can cover multiple weaknesses. For example:

- Ground (resist Grass and Rock)
- Fire (good against Grass and Water)
- Electric (can be strong against Grass and Flying)

But I have to avoid using indices 5,6,14.

Wait, index32 is Bug/Grass: which is strong against Grass and Bug. But also Weak against Wind and maybe others.

Alternatively, perhaps the best team is:

- 40: Steel/Ground (resist Rock, Ice)
- 49: Dragon/Ground (can cover Ground and have Dragon moves)
- 30: Steel, Max HP97

But let me check their types: 40 is Steel/Ground, 49 is Dragon/Ground, 30 is Steel.

Wait, but maybe including a Fire type would be better because it can handle Grass and Water. So perhaps:

- 39: Normal/Fire (covers Fire)
- 40: Steel/Ground
- 49: Dragon/Ground

But I'm not sure if that's the best choice. Alternatively, perhaps pick high HP with strong moves.

Alternatively, considering the previous team won, maybe stick with similar types but different indices.

Wait, in the end, it's hard to predict without knowing the opponent's types. So perhaps choosing three Ground type Pokémon would be safe because they can resist many attacks.

Looking at the list:

- 31: Ground/Electric
- 32: Bug/Grass (but not pure Ground)
- 34: Dark/Fight (no)
- 40: Steel/Ground
- 44: Flying/Ground
- 47: Ghost/Ground
- 49: Dragon/Ground

So possible candidates:

- 31, 40, 49. Types: Ground/Electric, Steel/Ground, Dragon/Ground.

This would give a strong mix of Ground types with some additional resistances.

Alternatively, maybe add a Fire type for coverage against Grass and Water.

But since I can't use index6 (Fire), perhaps choose another Fire type like index19 or 29.

But if I pick:

- 31: Ground/Electric
- 40: Steel/Ground
- 49: Dragon/Ground

That's three different types all with Ground, which is a solid foundation. Plus their high HP and strong moves should help in battle.

Alternatively, perhaps include a Ghost type for added versatility. But I have to choose from the given indices.

In the end, it's difficult without more info, but based on previous success, maybe the user wants to keep some similar types but replace with higher HP options.

Looking back at the last result: The team used indices 5,6,14 and won. So perhaps replacing them with other Ground/Electric, Fire, and maybe another type.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to pick three Pokémon that have high Max_HP, strong moves, and cover multiple types.

So considering:

- PkmTemplate 40: Steel/Ground, HP151
- PkmTemplate 49: Dragon/Ground, HP141
- PkmTemplate32: Bug/Grass, HP135

This gives a mix of Steel, Dragon, and Grass/Bug. But I'm not sure if that's better than others.

Alternatively, maybe pick three Fire types for coverage against Grass and Water.

But without knowing the opponent's type weaknesses, it's hard to choose optimally. So perhaps the best approach is to pick the three highest HP Pokémon with strong moves, even if their types are different.

Looking through the list:

- 40: Steel/Ground, Max PP151
- 49: Dragon/Ground, Max PP141
- 32: Bug/Grass, Max PP135

These have the highest HP among those with Ground. Alternatively, maybe include Electric for coverage against Flying and Grass.

But I have to choose exactly three indices, no more, no less, from the given roster, not using 5,6,14.

So perhaps:

- 31: Ground/Electric
- 40: Steel/Ground
- 49: Dragon/Ground

This would give coverage for Electric, Ground, and Dragon. Alternatively, maybe add a Fire type as well.

But I can only choose three indices. So maybe it's better to stick with Ground types since they are versatile.

Alternatively, perhaps the best team is:

---40, 31, 49---

Which corresponds to Steel/Ground, Ground/Electric, and Dragon/Ground.

This would provide a mix of resistances and strong moves.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster would be the best choice for the next battle. The last time, my team with indices [40, 31, 49] won, so I need to build a new team that's strong but also considers what worked before and what might work against the previous opponents.

First, I should look at each Pokémon in the roster and evaluate their strengths based on type, moves, max HP, etc. The goal is to maximize the chances of winning the next battle.

Let me start by recalling which types were used last time. The previous team included index 40 (Steel/Ground), 31 (Ground/Electric), and 49 (Dragon/Ground). So their types were mainly Ground, Steel, Electric, Dragon.

Now, I should think about possible opponents or the general meta of the game to choose types that are strong against what's common. Alternatively, maybe choosing types that complement each other would be better.

Looking at the current roster, there are many options. Let me go through some high HP Pokémon that might be good additions:

- Index 0: Ghost/Fire. Ghost is versatile with moves like Haunt and Shadow Force. Fire can deal with Ghosts.
- Index 1: Ghost. Pure Ghost type could be useful for status moves and support.
- Index 2: Dark. Good against Grass and Psychic, which are common.
- Index 3: Ground/Electric. Ground covers a lot of terrain, Electric can deal with Flying or Bug types.
- Index 4: Water. Useful against Fire and Dragon types.
- Index 5: Ground/ Poison. Another Ground option with Poison moves for versatility.
- Index 6: Fire. Strong offensive type, but might struggle against Ghosts.
- Index 7: Dragon/Steel. Can cover both Dragon and Steel, which are strong types.
- Index 8: Ice/Fairy. Fairy is good against Dragon and Dark.
- Index 9: Ground. Solid choice with moves like Sand Tomb and Poison.
- Index 10: Fairy/Water. Versatile with Water and Fairy moves.
- Index 11: Normal. Good for status and support but might not be the best offensive.
- Index 12: Bug/ Dragon. Can deal with Grass, but Dragon is strong.
- Index 13: Grass/Fire. Fire is good, and Grass covers a lot of types.
- Index 14: Electric/Ground. Similar to index 3, but different moves.
- Index 15: Dark. Another dark type, could be useful against Psychic or Fairy.
- Index 16: Grass. Good for grass coverage, maybe as a support.
- Index 17: Steel. Pure Steel can handle a lot of types.
- Index 18: Fairy. Useful against Dragon and Dark, plus status moves.
- Index 19: Fire. High HP, good offensive.
- Index 20: Fight/Bug. Can deal with Dragon and Bug types but might be niche.
- Index 21: Grass. Good for grass coverage, maybe as a support or attacker.
- Index 22: Fairy/Flying. Flying is useful against Ground and Rock, but Fairy adds more versatility.
- Index 23: Fairy. Similar to others but pure Fairy.
- Index 24: Ghost/Psychic. Could be good for status and Psychic resistance.
- Index 25: Dark/Fairy. Combines two strong types.
- Index 26: Psych/Fire. Fire is strong, but I'm not sure about the psychic moves here.
- Index 27: Ice/Ghost. Ice can handle Grass and Water, Ghost adds versatility.
- Index 28: Water. Good for Dragon and Fire.
- Index 29: Fire. Similar to index 6 but with more moves.
- Index 30: Steel. Another pure Steel, which is strong.
- Index 31: Ground/Electric (same as index 3). Not sure if it's better than others.
- Index 32: Bug/Grass. Grass is good, but Bug might not be the best for this meta.
- Index 33: Water/Poison. Water and Poison can handle a lot of types.
- Index 34: Dark/Fight. Fight is strong against Psychic and Fairy.
- Index 35: Psych/Ghost. Good for status and Psychic resistance.
- Index 36: Fly/Grass. Flying and Grass, versatile but maybe not the best.
- Index 37: Fight. Similar to index 20, niche.
- Index 38: Normal. Not the strongest unless used for support.
- Index 39: Normal/Fire. Fire is strong, Normal can handle status.
- Index 40: Steel/Ground (same as index 3). Maybe better than others.
- Index 41: Grass/Flying. Flying and Grass, good but maybe not the best.
- Index 42: Rock. Rock is strong against Fly and Ground but might be too niche.
- Index 43: Bug. Pure Bug, which is okay but maybe not top tier.
- Index 44: Fly/Grass (similar to others).
- Index 45: Dark. Another Dark type, could be useful.
- Index 46: Dark. Similar to others.
- Index 47: Ghost/Ground. Ground is versatile, Ghost adds more strength.
- Index 48: Fight/Dragon. Dragon and Fight, which is good against Psychic.
- Index 49: Dragon/Ground (same as index 7). Strong combination.

Now, considering the previous team won with [40,31,49], which are Steel/Ground, Ground/Electric, Dragon/Ground. So they covered multiple types including Ground, Electric, Steel, and Dragon.

I need to choose a new team that can cover multiple strong types and also have synergy. Maybe focus on types like Ground, Fire, and Dragon because those are common in the higher HP Pokémon.

Looking at high HP options:

- Index 49: Dragon/Ground (HP 141). Good for both Dragon and Ground.
- Index 0: Ghost/Fire (HP 160). Covers Fire and Ghost.
- Index 7: Dragon/Steel (HP 109). Another Dragon option with Steel.
- Index 20: Fight/Bug (HP 138). Can handle Dragon but might be too niche.
- Index 49 is already selected, so maybe pick another Dragon.

Alternatively, perhaps go for a team that covers Fire, Ghost, and Ground. That seems to be strong because Fire can deal with Water and Grass, Ghost handles Psychic and Dark, and Ground covers a lot of types.

Looking at the roster:

- Index 0: Ghost/Fire (HP 160). Fire and Ghost.
- Index 5: Ground/Poison (HP 136). Ground and Poison.
- Index 49: Dragon/Ground (HP 141). Dragon and Ground.

This team would have types: Fire, Ghost, Ground, Dragon. That's a good mix because:

- Fire can take down Water and Grass.
- Ghost is strong against Psychic and Dark.
- Ground covers Rock, Grass, Electric, etc.
- Dragon is strong against Ice and Fairy, as well as having great HP.

Alternatively, another option could be:

- Index 0: Ghost/Fire
- Index 5: Ground/Poison
- Index 7: Dragon/Steel

This gives Fire, Ghost, Ground, Dragon, Steel. All versatile types that cover a lot of matchups.

But I need to ensure the team is balanced and each member can contribute in different ways. Maybe including a strong single-type Pokemon could help.

Another thought: Since the last time they used 40 (Steel/Ground), 31 (Ground/Electric), 49 (Dragon/Ground). So maybe keep Ground for its versatility, add another Steel or Dragon, and perhaps a Fire/Ghost to take care of Psychic or Dark types.

So possible team:

- Index 0: Ghost/Fire
- Index 5: Ground/Poison
- Index 49: Dragon/Ground

This gives coverage across multiple types, including Fire, Ghost, Ground, and Dragon. Each has high HP and strong moves.

Alternatively, if I want more Electric or Steel:

- Index 3: Ground/Electric (HP 59). Maybe too low HP compared to others.
- Index 7: Dragon/Steel (HP 109).
So team could be:

- Index 0: Ghost/Fire
- Index 5: Ground/Poison
- Index 7: Dragon/Steel

This also covers Fire, Ghost, Ground, Steel, and Dragon. Maybe better type coverage.

But the HP of index 3 is only 59, which might be too low if facing strong Physical attackers. So perhaps it's better to pick higher HP options.

Another approach: Select the three highest HP Pokémon that cover different types. The top HPs are:

- 0:160
- 2:141
- 5:136
- 7:109
- 49:141

So choosing from these, perhaps:

- Index 0: Ghost/Fire (HP 160)
- Index 2: Dark/... Wait, index 2 is Dark but Type=Dark. Maybe not the best for coverage.
Wait, index 2's type is DARK, Max_HP=141.

But if I pick index 0 (Ghost/Fire), index5 (Ground/Poison), and index49 (Dragon/Ground). So:

- Fire: Good against Water, Grass
- Ghost: Good against Psychic, Dark
- Ground: Good against Rock, Grass, Electric
- Dragon: Good against Ice, Fairy, and has strong moves.

This seems solid. Also, the last result was a win, so maybe keeping similar types is good for consistency.

Alternatively, another combination could be:

- Index 0 (Ghost/Fire)
- Index 5 (Ground/Poison)
- Index 7 (Dragon/Steel)

This covers Fire, Ghost, Ground, Steel, Dragon. Maybe better type coverage because Steel can handle Electric and Rock, while Fire and Ghost cover other types.

But I need to ensure that the team isn't too focused on one type. So perhaps a balance is needed.

Another thought: Since they won last time with [40,31,49], which are 40 (Steel/Ground), 31 (Ground/Electric), and 49 (Dragon/Ground). So maybe continue using Ground because it's strong. Then add Fire to cover Water/Grass and Ghost for Psychic/Dark.

So team could be:

- Index0: Ghost/Fire
- Index5: Ground/Poison
- Index49: Dragon/Ground

This has four types: Fire, Ghost, Ground, Dragon. Each can handle multiple threats.

Alternatively, if I want more variety in moveset, maybe include a Electric type for STAB or something else, but since index3 is low HP, not sure.

Another consideration: The last battle probably had certain types that were strong. If the previous opponent used Psychic or Dark, then having Ghost would be beneficial. Also, if they had Water or Grass, Fire and Ground can counter them.

So overall, I think a team with Ghost/Fire, Ground/Poison, and Dragon/Ground is a good choice because:

- Ghost handles Psychic and Dark.
- Fire handles Water and Grass.
- Ground covers multiple types including Electric and Rock.
- Dragon adds another strong type with high HP.

Moreover, their movesets seem to have strong moves that can contribute in different ways. For example, Fire's moves include recoil for physical attacks, while Ground has STAB or other boosts.

Also, considering that the last Elo is 1248.97 after a win, maybe they want to maintain a winning strategy by keeping similar strengths.

Therefore, I would choose indices 0,5,49 as the new team.

Alright, so I need to figure out what Pokémon to choose for my next team. The previous team was indices [0, 5, 49], and my last battle resulted in a win with an Elo of 1268.08. My goal is to pick three Pokémon from the roster that can maximize my chances of winning the next battle.

First, I should look at what types were used before. The previous team had Ghost/Fire (index 0), Ground/ Poison (index 5), and Dragon/Ground (index 49). So their types were a mix of Ghost, Fire, Ground, and Poison. Maybe I need to consider complementary types or something that can cover different weaknesses.

Looking at the current roster, there are many options. Since my last team won, maybe sticking with strong attackers could help. I should check each Pokémon's type, moves, Max HP, and how they might synergize together.

Let me list out some potential candidates:

1. Pkm 0: Ghost/Fire - Has good moves like Poison, which can be useful against Grass and Water types.
2. Pkm 5: Ground/Poison - Good for taking down Grass and Ground opponents with moves like Earthquake.
3. Pkm 49: Dragon/Ground - Can cover both Dragon and Ground, which might be strong against Ice and Air moves.

But maybe I can find better combinations elsewhere. For example:

- Pkm 1 is Ghost type with Normal and Grass moves. It could support a Fire or Water team, but not sure.
- Pkm 6: Fire type, strong moves like Psychic and Fire attacks. Could be good for offensive roles.
- Pkm 13: Grass/Fire, which can cover both Grass and Fire, making it versatile against many types.
- Pkm 14: Electric/Ground, which is great for dealing with flying or grass opponents.
- Pkm 19: Fire type, with good moves like Dark and Poison. It could be a strong offensive choice.

I also need to consider the previous team's types and see what they might have been weak against. For example, if last time they had Ground and Poison, maybe I should avoid using similar types unless necessary.

Another consideration is the effectiveness of each Pokémon's moves. High-power moves like Psychic or Dark can be strong. Also, special attacks versus physical might matter depending on the opposing team.

Wait, the previous team used 0 (Ghost/Fire), 5 (Ground/Poison), and 49 (Dragon/Ground). So they covered a lot of ground types and some poison. Maybe for the next team, I should focus on different types that can exploit weaknesses. For example, Fire is strong against Water and Grass, so maybe having another Fire type could help.

Looking at Pkm 6: Fire with high Power moves like Psychic (140 power). That seems strong. Pkm 13 is also Grass/Fire, which can support both types.

Pkm 14: Electric/Ground could be good for dealing with flying or grass opponents, using moves like Thunderbolt and Earthquake.

So putting it together, maybe:

- Pkm 6 (Fire) for strong Fire attacks.
- Pkm 13 (Grass/Fire) to cover both Grass and Fire.
- Pkm 14 (Electric/Ground) for versatile ground attacks and electric coverage.

This combination would give me Fire, Grass, and Ground types, covering a wide range of possibilities. Fire can take down Water and Grass, Electric can handle Flying and Ground, and Grass can support against Grass enemies.

Alternatively, if I think about the previous team's success, maybe sticking with similar strong attackers is better. For example, keeping Pkm 49 (Dragon/Ground) because it's versatile. Then adding two more strong types like Fire and Electric.

Wait, but in the initial response, the assistant suggested using indices 14, 30, and 49. Let me check those:

- Pkm 14: Electric/Ground
- Pkm 30: Steel with moves including Water and Ghost.
- Pkm 49: Dragon/Ground

Hmm, that's a mix of Electric, Steel, and Dragon/Ground. I'm not sure if that's the best combination. Maybe it's better to have three strong offensive types that can cover multiple weaknesses.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing Fire, Grass, and Electric could be more balanced. But I need to see which Pokémon in the roster has the highest Max HP and most effective moves.

Looking again:

- Pkm 6: Fire with high Power moves (Psychic 140).
- Pkm 13: Grass/Fire with good coverage.
- Pkm 14: Electric/Ground, which is strong against Flying and Ground.

So perhaps using 6, 13, and 14 would be a strong team. But the initial response used 14, 30, 49. I'm not sure why those were chosen, but maybe they have specific synergy.

Alternatively, if I think about the previous team's types (Ghost, Ground, Dragon), perhaps avoiding overrepresentation of certain types is better. So adding Fire, Electric, and another type that covers their weaknesses might be key.

I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should look for Pokémon with high Max HP and strong moves. Pkm 49 has Max HP 141, which is quite high. Pkm 30: Steel with Max HP 97. Pkm14: Electric/Ground with 84 HP.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant thought that those indices provide a good mix of types, including Electric (for air), Steel (for Ground and Water), and Dragon/Ground for versatility.

But I'm not entirely sure if that's optimal. Maybe the Fire type is better because it can take down more types.

In any case, since I need to follow the previous response, perhaps the assistant chose 14,30,49 based on some strategy. So I'll go with that.

Okay, so I need to figure out a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The user lost their last battle with an Elo of 1258.68. Their previous team used indices [0, 1, 2], which won in past matches. Now, they have a new roster and need to choose three Pokémon to maximize their chances next time.

First, I should look at the types that were successful before. The winning team was using types that probably complement each other well. Looking back, maybe they had a good balance of offense and defense or coverage of different typings.

Now, looking at the current roster, I need to pick three Pokémon that can work together effectively. I'll consider their types, movesets, and stats like Max HP to ensure they can survive battles.

I notice that Ghost/Fire (0), Dark (2), and either Electric/Ground (14) or Ground/POISON (5) might be strong choices. These types cover a mix of offense, defense, and resistances that could work well together. They also have decent Max HP to handle fights.

Alternatively, another strong trio could be Fire (6, 9, 19), which are high HP and have powerful moves. But I need to ensure they can take down the opponents effectively.

Wait, Ghost/Fire has strong moves like MISTY_TERRAIN and DARK, which can boost effectiveness. Dark type also has good resistances and offensive options. Adding Electric/Ground for STUN or other electric moves could provide additional support.

I think choosing 0 (Ghost/Fire), 2 (Dark), and 14 (Electric/Ground) would create a balanced team with great coverage. They have high Max HP, useful moves, and complementary types that can handle various challenges.

Alright, so I need to figure out a new Pokémon team after my last one lost. My previous team was using indices [0, 2, 14]. Now, I have to choose three from the given roster to maximize my chances next time.

First, I'll review the Roster provided. Each Pokémon has Type, Max_HP, and Moves. Since my last team lost, I should probably look for Pokémon that can cover different types effectively or have strong moves that could complement each other.

My previous team was:
- Index 0: Ghost/Fire
- Index 2: Dark
- Index 14: Electric/Ground

So, those were three distinct types: Ghost, Dark, and Ground/Electric. Maybe I should look for similar coverage but with better stats or moves.

Looking through the Roster:

Index 30 is Steel with Max_HP=97. Steel can help cover steel-type foes and has some good moves. Its Moves include Water and GHOST, which could be useful forcoverage.

Index 49 is Dragon/Ground with Max_HP=141. Ground is already covered by 14, but Dragon adds a new type and has strong physical attacks. It also has moves like PSYCHIC and POISON, which can help in battles.

Index 35 is Psychic/Ghost with Max_HP=128. Psychic can support by dealing mental damage or boosting allies, and Ghost is a solid defensive type.

Wait, but my previous team had Dark (index 2) and Fire/Ghost (0). Maybe having another Ghost could be redundant. Alternatively, I might want to replace some of them for better effectiveness.

Looking at index 49 again: Dragon/Ground has high HP and good moves like PSYCHIC and POISON. That seems strong. Index 30 is Steel with useful moves including Water and GHOST, which can help control the battlefield.

Alternatively, maybe index 35's Psychic could be a good addition for status moves or boosts. But I'm not sure if three types are enough. Maybe I should pick based on type coverage and move strengths.

Another consideration: each Pokémon's Move list—looking for high-power moves, accuracy, and PP. For example, index 30 has Power 111 with Steel, which is strong against Rock. Index 49 has PSYCHIC which can be used multiple times. 

I think the key is to have a mix of types that are effective against each other (e.g., Ground vs. Air) and have strong individual moves. So, choosing indices 30, 35, and 49 seems like a solid choice because they cover different types with powerful moves.

Wait, but I need exactly three indices. Let me double-check: previous team was [0,2,14], which is Ghost/Fire, Dark, Electric/Ground. Now, picking 30 (Steel), 35 (Psychic/Ghost), and 49 (Dragon/Ground). That adds more coverage with Steel, Psychic, and Dragon types.

Alternatively, maybe index 31: Ground/Electric could be a good replacement for 14, as it has higher accuracy moves. But I'm not sure about that.

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to pick the three highest Max_HP Pokémon that can cover different types effectively. So, indices with high HP and strong move sets would be better. Looking through the Roster again:

Index 49: Dragon/Ground (141 HP) - High HP, good moves.
Index 30: Steel (97 HP) - Solid stats, useful type coverage.
Index 35: Psychic/Ghost (128 HP) - Good HP, versatile type.

Yes, these three should provide a strong team with good type combinations and high individual strengths. So, the new team indices would be 30, 35, 49.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what Pokémon to choose for my next battle. It's my first time, so I don't have any prior results or data from previous wins or losses. The goal is to pick three Pokémon from the given roster that will give me the best chance of winning.

First, I need to understand how each Pokémon's type affects battles. Each type has strengths and weaknesses against other types. For example, if my team has a lot of strong types against the opponent's types, we're more likely to win.

Looking at the roster, there are 50 templates, but many are duplicates or have similar stats. I should focus on ones with high Max_HP because higher health points mean better survivability, which is crucial in battles.

I also need to consider their moves. Moves with high power, accuracy, and multiple types can be advantageous. Some moves provide status effects like Protect, which can make the team stronger, or Ignore Evasion, which can bypass certain defensive moves.

Another factor is type coverage. It's good to have a mix of types that can cover each other's weaknesses. For example, having a Ground Pokémon can counter Flying and Ice types, while a Steel type can handle Rock and Ice.

Since this is the first battle, I don't know what the opponent will be using. So, I should choose versatile Pokémon who can adapt to different opponents. High accuracy and strong multi-type moves are important because they can handle a variety of situations.

Looking at each template:

- Template 14: Water type with good moves like Ground and Trickroom. It has high HP and some strong moves.
- Template 30: Psychic/Dragon, which is unique but might not cover all types.
- Template 49: Steel type with multiple strong moves and good HP.

I need to ensure that together, these three can handle a range of types. Water covers Ground and Grass; Steel covers Rock and Ice; Psychic can handle Ghosts and Flyers. This combination seems versatile enough for various opponents.

Each of these Pokémon has high Max_HP and powerful moves that can contribute to both offense and defense. They also have moves like Trickroom and Protect, which can provide strategic advantages in battle.

So, the team would be indices 14 (Water), 30 (Psychic/Dragon), and 49 (Steel). This setup offers good type coverage, high health points, and strong offensive capabilities, making it a solid choice for my first battle.

Okay, so I need to help this user create a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The user has won their last battle with Elo 1215, and their previous team was [14, 30, 49]. So they have three Pokémon that worked well before. Now they want a new team to maximize chances for the next battle.

Looking at the Roster, there are 50 Pokémon templates with various types, Max HP, and moves. The goal is to choose three that can complement each other, counter weaknesses, and possibly exploit the opponent's weaknesses.

First, I should recall what each of the previous indices (14, 30, 49) represents. Let me check their types:

- 14: WATER
- 30: PSYCHIC/DRAGON
- 49: STEEL

So the last team had a Water, Psychic/Dragon, and Steel type Pokémon.

Now, to build a new team, I should consider what types are covered and what might be missing or beneficial. Let's see:

Water is already in the team (index 14). Steel is also there (49). Psychic/Dragon is index 30. So the last team had Water, Steel, and Psychic/Dragon.

What types do these cover? Let me think about type effectiveness:

- Water covers Ice, Grass, Fire (if opposing), etc.
- Steel resists Rock, Ice, Fire, etc.
- Psychic can handle Ghost, Psychic, Dark, etc.

So the last team was well-rounded. Now, to maximize the new team, perhaps include types that complement these and might counter common opponents.

Looking at the roster, I need to find Pokémon that are strong, have good coverage, and maybe synergy with each other.

Let me go through some options:

- Index 0: Steel/Normal. Could add another Steel for coverage.
- Index 1: Steel/Dark. Adds Dark resistance and can be good against Ghosts.
- Index 2: Grass. Good against Water and Grass types, but might not be necessary if already covered.
- Index 3: Ice/Rock. Nice for counters like Ice or Rock types.
- Index 4: Bug/Water. Adds Bug type which is useful against Psychic and Dark.
- Index 5: Ground. Good against Grass, Water, etc., and resistant to Electric.
- Index 6: Ground/Water. Could be a good addition for dual-type coverage.

Wait, but the user's previous team had Water (14) and Steel (49). So adding another type that complements these could help. Let me think about possible types:

Fighting is versatile because it can cover multiple types. For example, Fighting is effective against Ice, Rock, Dragon, etc. Also, Fighting Pokémon often have access to moves like Close Combat or Psycho Cut which are strong physical attacks.

Looking for a Fighting type that's strong. Index 17: FIGHT. Max HP 104, moves include Electric and others. It could provide good coverage.

Another option is Ghost, which resists Psychic. Since the previous team had a Psychic/Dragon (30), having a Ghost would be good to counter it. Looking at index 9: GHOST/FAIRY. But that's already in use? Wait no, the user hasn't used it before. So adding a Ghost type could help against Psychic.

Alternatively, Dark types are also resistant to Psychic. Index 1 is Steel/Dark, but maybe another Dark type could be useful. Let me check index 18: FIGHT/POISON. That's not Dark. Maybe index 37: POISON. But that's only Poison.

Wait, index 26: GHOST/FIRE. Fire can be good against Water and Ice. But the team already has Water, so Fire could help in that regard. Also, Ghost would counter Psychic.

Alternatively, maybe a Dragon type to boost the Psychic/Dragon (30). Index 30 is already there. So another Dragon might not be necessary unless for synergy.

Let me think about the moves each Pokémon has. High accuracy, strong attack moves are important. For example, index 49: STEEL has Dark and Power 140, which is good against Dark types.

Wait, maybe I should look for Pokémon that have strong coverage against common types or have abilities that synergize well with each other.

Another approach is to pick the highest Max HP to ensure survival in battle. So looking at the Roster, indices like 34 (Dark 160), 35 (Electric 144), etc.

But the user's previous team had a Water (84 HP) and others, so maybe choosing higher HP could help in longevity.

Wait, but without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to optimize fully. So I need to make educated guesses based on type coverage and synergy.

Perhaps selecting:

- A Steel/Dark (index 1): For Dark resistance and strong moves.
- A Ground/Water (index 6 or 15): To cover multiple types and have Water which can be countered by Ice, etc.
- A Psychic/Dragon (index 30): As before, but maybe a different one? Or maybe another type.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Dragon to boost the Psychic team. But index 30 is already there.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to pick three that are strong and complementary.

Looking at index 34: Dark/160 HP. It has moves like Dragon, MISTY_TERRAIN, etc. Could be good against certain types.

Index 35: Electric/144. Good against Fire, Ice, etc., with Tailwind and other moves.

Index 43: Steel/Flying/160. Adds Steel which is strong, and Flying can handle Electric and Rock.

Wait, but the previous team had Steel (49). So maybe another type instead of Steel.

Alternatively, index 36: Grass/124. Good against Psychic, Water, etc., with nice moves like Power 131.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should focus on types that are strong against others and have high HP.

Another thought: The previous team won, so maybe keeping some similar types but adjusting for weaknesses could help.

Wait, the user's last result was a win with Elo 1215, so they are doing well. They might want to continue with a strong team.

I think I need to choose three that have good coverage, high HP, and useful moves.

Looking again:

- Index 34: Dark/160. Resistant to Psychic, has Dragon move which can be good against Fire, Water, etc.
- Index 35: Electric/144. Good against Fire, Ice, Water.
- Index 43: Steel/Flying/160. Covers Steel and Flying.

Alternatively:

- Index 26: Ghost/Fire/160. Resists Psychic, has Fire moves.
- Index 30: Psychic/Dragon/69. Synergizes with others.
- Index 49: Steel/160. Strong and covers multiple types.

But the user already had a Steel (49) in their last team, so maybe adding different types would be better.

Wait, no, the previous indices were [14,30,49], which are Water, Psychic/Dragon, Steel. So now, for the new team, perhaps include another type that's strong and complementary.

Perhaps:

- Dark (index 1): For resistance against Psychic.
- Ground (index 5 or 6): To cover multiple types and have high HP.
- Dragon (another index like 30 is already there; maybe 32: FIGHT/GHOST).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to choose based on type coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing the highest HP Pokémon could be beneficial. Let me see:

- Index 34: Dark/160
- Index 35: Electric/144
- Index 36: Grass/124

But maybe that's too spread out. Alternatively, focus on types like Steel, Ground, and Psychic/Dragon.

Wait, perhaps I should look for Pokémon with self-switch or abilities that can boost team stats.

Another idea: Choose the top three in terms of Max PP or accuracy to ensure moves hit.

Alternatively, think about which Pokémon have strong multi-type coverage.

I think I need to make a choice here. Based on the previous team's types (Water, Psychic/Dragon, Steel), maybe adding a Ground type for coverage and another strong type.

So, perhaps:

- Index 5: Ground/106. Covers multiple types with good moves.
- Index 30: Psychic/Dragon/69. Synergizes well.
- Index 49: Steel/160. Strong and covers multiple types.

Alternatively, replace one of them. But since the previous team had these indices, maybe it's better to rotate one for a stronger option.

In conclusion, I think choosing indices based on type coverage, high HP, and useful abilities is key. So perhaps:

---14, 30, 49---
But wait, they were already used before. Maybe it's time to replace them with different but strong options.

Alternatively, choose:

- Index 34: Dark/160
- Index 35: Electric/144
- Index 43: Steel/Flying/160

But I'm not sure if that's better than the previous team.

Wait, perhaps the user wants a similar setup but different Pokémon. So maybe keeping one type and replacing others.

I think without more info, it's hard to know exactly, so I'll go with:

---14, 30, 49---
But wait, they were used last time. Maybe it's better to pick new indices.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants a team that can counter the previous opponent effectively.

Given all this, I think the best approach is to select three Pokémon that together cover multiple types, have strong moves, and high HP, possibly replacing one or two from the previous team.

After considering, I'll choose:

---34, 35, 43---

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps:

---14, 30, 49---
Wait, but they were used last time. Maybe it's better to rotate for variety.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which three Pokémon from this roster would give me the best chance of winning the next battle. It's my first time, so I don't have any prior results or data to base this on. 

First, I need to understand what each Pokémon in the roster brings to the table. Each has a Type, Max HP, and a list of Moves with their effects. My goal is to pick three that complement each other well in terms of Types, Move coverage, and stats to maximize our chances against whatever the opponent might throw at us.

Looking through the roster, I see a variety of Types: Fire, Poison, Fairy, Dragon, Electric/Water, Ground, etc. Since it's my first battle, maybe having a balanced team with good coverage is important. Maybe types that can cover multiple weaknesses would be better.

I also notice Max HP values; higher HP usually means better survivability. So selecting Pokémon with high HP could help in extending the battle length, which might give me more time to strategize or for my allies to weaken the opponent.

Looking at the Moves, I'm interested in moves that can deal consistent damage, have good accuracy, or provide boosts. For example, moves that boost my team's stats (like Self Boosts) could be beneficial, especially if they stack with others.

Let me start by listing out some promising candidates:

- PkmTemplate 0: Fire Type, decent HP, has a variety of moves including Power, Reflect, and Trickroom. The high Max PP might help in keeping moves active longer.
- PkmTemplate 1: Poison, lower HP but has Ground and Steel coverage, which are solid Types. It also has Self Boosts which could help in team synergy.
- PkmTemplate 3: Dragon, very high HP (142), good offensive moves with Power and Trickroom. This seems like a strong all-rounder.
- PkmTemplate 4: Electric/Water, decent HP, good coverage with Ground and Rock. It also has Ignore Evasion, which could be useful against certain moves that target AI.
- PkmTemplate 14: Ghost/Fire, high HP (137), good offensive moves like Steel and Normal. The Type mix could provide versatility.

Now, considering team synergy is crucial. I want each Pokémon to cover different weaknesses and complement each other's moves. Fire and Water are good for coverage against Grass and Fire-type opponents. Poison can handle Ground and Steel, while Dragon can take care of multiple Types.

I also need to check if there are any synergistic moves that can stack. For instance, having multiple Reflectors or Ignore Evasion can be powerful against certain AI strategies. PkmTemplate 1 has a Reflect move, which could help in reducing damage taken from physical attacks.

Another consideration is the Priority of moves. Some moves have priority over others, which can be important in multi-turn battles. PkmTemplate 0 and 14 both have Priority 1 moves, which is good for timely offense.

Looking at HP, templates 3 and 4 have the highest Max HP (142 and 122 respectively), so they might be worth including for their survivability.

I should also avoid having too many redundant Types. For example, having multiple Fire types might not provide coverage against other Type strengths. Instead, a mix of Fire, Poison, and Dragon seems beneficial as each covers different areas.

PkmTemplate 1 is interesting because it's Poison with Ground and Steel coverage. This can handle a lot of common defensive Types, which is helpful. Plus, its Self Boosts could help in boosting team stats for better overall performance.

PkmTemplate 3, being Dragon, adds another layer of defense with its own set of moves including Power and Trickroom, which can be effective against certain opponents.

Now, putting it all together, I think selecting PkmTemplates 0 (Fire), 1 (Poison), and 3 (Dragon) would give me a well-rounded team. Fire provides offensive power and some defensive moves, Poison handles multiple defensive Types with boosts, and Dragon adds both high HP and versatile moves.

Alternatively, considering PkmTemplate 4 might provide Electric and Water coverage, which could be useful against Grass and Electric types. However, the HP is slightly lower compared to others, so I'm not sure if it's better than including another strong offensive Pokémon like Dragon.

Wait, maybe I should include PkmTemplate 3 (Dragon) for its high HP and versatility, then have a mix of Fire and Poison to cover both offensive and defensive needs. That way, I can handle a variety of opponent Types effectively.

Another angle is the use of Ignore Evasion or Reflect moves. PkmTemplate 4 has Ignore Evasion which could be useful against AI's evasion-based moves, but it doesn't have Reflect. PkmTemplate 1 has Reflect, so that might be more beneficial in protecting against physical attacks.

So, perhaps combining Fire (0) for offensive power and defense with Reflect from PkmTemplate 1, and then a strong Dragon (3) to cover the rest.

Alternatively, using PkmTemplate 4's Electric/Water for coverage against Grass and Electric types could also be effective. It might depend on what the opponent is weak against.

But since it's my first battle, I might want to go with what's known to be strong. High HP, versatile moves, and good Type coverage are key. So maybe PkmTemplates 3 (Dragon), 14 (Ghost/Fire), and 1 (Poison). The Dragon would handle a variety of types, the Ghost/Fire adds Fire and Ghost coverage, which can help with certain opponents, and Poison provides solid defensive and offensive capabilities.

Wait, but I need to pick exactly three. Let me make sure each Type is covered: Fire, Poison, and Dragon. That covers a broad range of possible opponent Types.

Alternatively, if I go for higher HP, PkmTemplate 3 (Dragon) has the highest HP at 142, which is great. Then, adding PkmTemplate 14 (Ghost/Fire) with high HP and good offensive moves, and maybe PkmTemplate 1 (Poison) for coverage and boosts.

Another thought: Maybe including a strong attacker alongside supportive Pokémon. For example, Dragon for its high damage output and versatility, Fire for consistent offense, and Poison for defensive roles.

I think I'm overcomplicating it a bit. Maybe the best approach is to select the three with the highest Max HP that also have strong move sets. So, PkmTemplate 3 (Dragon), 4 (Electric/Water), and 0 (Fire). That way, I have high HP, good offensive moves, and multiple Type coverages.

Wait, but Dragon alone might not provide enough coverage against certain types unless combined with others. Fire covers Fire and Grass, Electric/Water covers Water and Rock, so that's a solid combination. Maybe that trio is better for overall coverage.

Alternatively, PkmTemplate 3 (Dragon), 1 (Poison), and 4 (Electric/Water). Dragon provides all-around strength, Poison handles Ground and Steel, Electric/Water covers Electric and Water, which together cover a lot of ground.

Hmm, I'm still torn. Maybe I should look at the move sets more closely to see if there's any synergy or powerful moves that can tip the scales in our favor.

PkmTemplate 3 has Power, Trickroom, which are great for dealing damage and controlling the battlefield. PkmTemplate 1 has Self Boosts which could help in boosting our team's stats. PkmTemplate 4 has Ignore Evasion, which might prevent their moves from succeeding as much.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on physical attackers since they can be more consistent. Fire and Dragon are both physical types, so that gives me two strong physical attackers with high HP. Then, adding a Poison for defense and boosts would make the team versatile.

I think I need to decide based on which combination covers the most Types and has the highest individual strengths. Maybe PkmTemplate 3 (Dragon), 14 (Ghost/Fire), and 1 (Poison) is the optimal choice as it combines high HP, strong offense, and solid defensive capabilities.

Wait, but I also notice that PkmTemplate 30 is Ground/Rock with very high Max HP of 160. Maybe including that could provide rock coverage which is useful against many types. However, if the opponent is Rock weak, but since it's a simplified Pokémon game, maybe we should aim for a balanced team.

I think I've thought through this enough. My final choice would be to select PkmTemplate 3 (Dragon), 14 (Ghost/Fire), and 1 (Poison) as they offer a good balance of high HP, versatile moves, and strong Type coverage.

Okay, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their previous success. They won last time with indices [3, 14, 30], and their Elo is now 1215. The goal is to maximize their chances in the next battle by picking three Pokémon from the given roster.

First, I'll look at what each of those previous indices represents. Index 3 is Dragon, which usually has high HP and good moves like Water and Electric attacks. Index 14 is Ghost/Fire, offering both offensive and defensive capabilities with moves like Trickroom. Index 30 is Ground/Rock, providing solid physical defense and access to powerful moves like Rock Smash.

Now, thinking about their last battle's type coverage. Dragon covers multiple types, but maybe they need more variety or stronger options this time. The user won before, so perhaps they want to maintain some of the same strengths but improve other aspects.

Looking at the roster, I should find Pokémon that are strong against common opponents and have high HP and accurate moves. Also, considering their previous team's types—Dragon, Ghost/Fire, Ground/Rock—it might be good to include a Fire type for support or another Dragon for more versatility.

I'll go through each index one by one:

- Index 3: Dragon is still strong because of its wide range of moves and high HP. It's a solid choice.
- Index 14: Ghost/Fire adds both offensive and defensive utility, especially with Trickroom which can confuse opponents.
- Index 30: Ground/Rock provides good physical defense and attack coverage.

Now, considering possible replacements or additions:

Looking for other strong types like Electric or Water to complement their team. Maybe adding an Electric type for support or another Dragon for more versatility.

But since the user's last team won, maybe they want to keep what worked but enhance it slightly. So perhaps replacing one member with a stronger version of a similar role.

Wait, but they only need three, so I should pick the best options available. Let me compare each index again:

- 3: Dragon, very strong with high HP and multiple useful moves.
- 14: Ghost/Fire, good all-rounder with Trickroom.
- 30: Ground/Rock, solid physical attacker.

I might consider if there are other types that would synergize better. For example, adding an Electric type could help with Electric attacks or provide immunity to certain moves.

Looking at the available templates, maybe index 48 is a good choice. It's Ground/Flying with high HP and accurate moves like Dark and Rock. This could add more versatility to the team.

Alternatively, perhaps index 47: Bug, but it might not cover as many types as needed. Or index 49: Ice, which is a good defensive type.

Wait, let me double-check each template:

Index 3: Dragon (Type=DRAGON, Max_HP=142) – High HP, strong moves.
Index 14: Ghost/Fire (Type=GHOST/FIRE, Max_HP=137) – Good all-rounder with Trickroom.
Index 30: Ground/Rock (Type=GROUND/ROCK, Max_HP=160) – Solid physical attacker.

If I were to replace one, maybe index 3 can be replaced with a stronger Dragon type or another type that complements. But if the team is performing well, perhaps keeping the same trio makes sense unless there's a better option.

Looking for other strong options:

- Index 7: Dragon (Type=DRAGON, Max_HP=113) – Another Dragon but lower HP.
- Index 49: Ice (Type=ICE, Max_HP=160) – Strong defensive type with good moves like Rock and Electric.

Alternatively, maybe index 3 is still the best for its high HP. So perhaps keeping [14, 30, 3] or adding another strong member like 49.

But the user might prefer to stick with the previous team that worked, so maybe not changing anything unless necessary.

Wait, but in their last match, they used indices 3, 14, and 30, which won. So perhaps they performed well with those three, and it's better to keep them unless a better combination exists.

Looking at other indices:

- Index 20: Poison (Type=POISON, Max_HP=109) – Could add more poison resistance.
- Index 22: Fire (Type=FIRE, Max_HP=86) – Maybe too low HP compared to others.

I think the best choice is to keep the same team as before since they won. However, if I need to choose three, maybe including index 3 (Dragon), 14 (Ghost/Fire), and 30 (Ground/Rock) again would be optimal.

But wait, the user's last result was a win, so their Elo increased, indicating success. Therefore, maintaining the same team might not be necessary unless there are better options.

Alternatively, perhaps including index 49: Ice for additional defense and Electric moves could be beneficial.

So maybe choosing [14, 30, 49] as the new team.

But I need to make sure each choice is the best possible. Let's compare their HP:

- Index 3: 142
- Index 14: 137
- Index 30: 160
- Index 49: 160

So both 30 and 49 have high HP, which is good.

Now, considering their movesets:

Index 30: Ground/Rock with Rock Smash (Physical, Power 106) – Strong attacker.
Index 49: Ice with Rock (Physical, Accuracy 0.88) and Electric Terrain – Good defensive and offensive moves.

So perhaps replacing index 3 with index 49 would make the team stronger, keeping 14 and 30.

Alternatively, maybe including a Dragon type is better for versatility.

But since they already have a Ghost/Fire and Ground/Rock, adding another Dragon might provide more coverage.

Wait, but their last team had Dragon (3), Ghost/Fire (14), and Ground/Rock (30). If I were to replace index 3 with another strong type, perhaps Electric or Water.

Looking for an Electric type, maybe index 38: Electric with high HP and good moves like Ice and Fire.

Alternatively, index 11: Water – Strong Water moves.

Hmm, but without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to say. But since they won last time, their current team is effective.

In conclusion, the best approach is to choose a team that covers multiple types, has high HP, and strong moves. The indices 14 (Ghost/Fire), 30 (Ground/Rock), and 3 (Dragon) provide a good balance of defense, offense, and type coverage.

So I'll stick with those three as they have performed well before.

Okay, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their previous performance and the available roster. Let me break down what I have.

First, the last result says they won with an Elo of 1231.29. Their previous teams were [3,14,30], which are indices for Dragon, Ghost/Fire, and Ground/Rock types respectively. So their last team was a mix of Dragon, Ghost/Fire, and Ground/Rock.

Now, the user wants to maximize their chances in the next battle. I should look at the Roster and see which Pokémon can complement each other effectively. Since their last team won, they might want to keep some strong types or strategies that worked before but also introduce new strengths.

Looking at the previous indices: 3 is Dragon, which is a versatile type with strong offensive capabilities. 14 is Ghost/Fire, which can deal with Ghosts and Fire types, and 30 is Ground/Rock, good against Rock and Ground opponents.

So, to create a new team, I should consider what each of these Pokémon brings and how they can synergize. Maybe adding another Dragon or a strong type that counters common opponents.

Looking at the Roster again, there are other strong types like Electric, Water, Poison, etc. But I need to pick three that work well together. Perhaps selecting a Dragon, a Ghost/Fire, and a Ground/Rock again but maybe with higher HP or better moves.

Wait, but the previous team had 3,14,30. Maybe keeping similar types would be good for consistency. Alternatively, introducing a new type like Electric or Water could add more coverage.

But since their last team won, sticking to what worked might be safer. So perhaps choosing the same indices again if they're still effective. However, maybe there are other strong templates that can improve their team.

Alternatively, I should look for Pokémon with high Max HP and strong moves. For example, index 49 is Ice with high HP and good moves, but not sure how it complements others. Index 30 has Ground/Rock which is already in the previous team.

Wait, perhaps choosing a different Ghost type or another Dragon could provide more versatility. Let me check the Roster again for similar types.

Looking at index 14: Ghost/Fire. That's good against Ghosts and Fire types. If I add another Ghost Pokémon, it might help against future opponents with Ghost types. Similarly, Dragon is strong against many types.

So maybe selecting a Dragon, a Ghost/Fire, and a Ground/Rock again could be effective. Alternatively, if the user wants to switch up, perhaps adding an Electric type for support.

But without knowing the exact opponent types they'll face next, it's hard to adjust specifically. So perhaps the best approach is to choose high HP, strong moves, and complementary types.

In the Roster, index 30 (Ground/Rock) has high Max HP of 160 and strong moves. Index 14 (Ghost/Fire) also has good stats. Index 3 (Dragon) is a strong attacker. So maybe keeping these indices makes sense.

Alternatively, if they want to introduce a new type, perhaps Electric or Water, but that might require replacing one of the existing types. But since they won last time, maybe sticking with what worked is better for consistency.

Wait, but the user's previous response chose 14,30,48. Let me see why 48 was chosen. Index 48 is Ground/Flying, which adds a Flying type to the team. Maybe they felt that adding a Flying Pokémon could provide good coverage against certain types and add versatility with its moves.

So if I follow that logic, keeping two of their previous strong indices (14 and 30) and adding 48 as a new member might balance the team well. Alternatively, maybe replacing one for better stats or move sets.

Wait, but in the initial response, they kept 14,30 and added 48. So perhaps that's an optimal choice. I need to see what each of these brings.

Index 14: Ghost/Fire - good against Ghosts and Fire types, has good moves like Trickroom and Power boosts.
Index 30: Ground/Rock - strong against Rock and Ground, high HP, good moves like Reflect and Power 140.
Index 48: Ground/Flying - can switch between Ground and Flying, which is useful for terrain changes, and has high Max PP.

So together, they cover Ground, Rock, Fire, Ghost, and Flying. That's a well-rounded team with good defensive and offensive capabilities. Plus, the Flying type adds mobility and flexibility.

I think that makes sense. So the new team would be 14,30,48.

Okay, so I need to help someone build a better Pokémon team after their last loss. Let's see what information I have. The previous battle used indices 14, 30, and 48. They lost, so now they're trying to improve.

First, I should look at the types of those Pokémon. Index 14 is Ghost/Fire, 30 is Ground/Rock, and 48 is Ice. So their last team had Ghost, Fire, Ground, Rock, and Ice types. Maybe their moves didn't cover certain typings that the opposing team might have. 

Looking at the Roster, I need to find three Pokémon that can complement each other's strengths. Since they lost last time, maybe their previous team was weak against something. Let me check each Pokémon's type and their moves.

Index 0: Fire - Good offense with high HP. Maybe it can support the team.
Index 1: Poison - Good for status moves and switching.
Index 2: Fairy - Nice offensive moves but low Max HP.
Index 3: Dragon - High HP, good moves like Water and Electric.
Index 4: Electric/Water - Versatile with both types.
Index 5: Ground - Solid defensive and attacking moves.
Index 6: Fire/Flying - Fire attacks and flying for utility.
Index 7: Dragon - Similar to index 3, but different moves.
Index 8: Dark - Good for status and defense.
Index 9: Poison/Grass - Versatile with poison and grass.
Index 10: Flying/Ground - Good defensive coverage.
Index 11: Water - Strong water moves.
Index 12: Fight - Balanced attacker.
Index 13: Fire - Similar to index 0 but different moves.
Index 14: Ghost/Fire - Already used last time, maybe not again.
Index 15: Ice/Rock - Could help with ice and rock coverage.
Index 16: Ghost/Normal - Good for status and normal moves.
Index 17: Water - Strong water moves.
Index 18: Bug - Good for grass and bug attacks.
Index 19: Dark - Similar to index 8.
Index 20: Poison - Versatile poison moves.
Index 21: Poison/Fire - Combines poison and fire.
Index 22: Fire - Another Fire type, maybe not needed.
Index 23: Poison - Strong poison moves.
Index 24: Normal/Bug - Good for normal and bug coverage.
Index 25: Fight - Similar to index 12.
Index 26: Bug - More bug moves.
Index 27: Fire/Poison - Combines fire and poison.
Index 28: Dragon/Fire - High HP with dragon and fire.
Index 29: Fight/Grass - Balanced with grass.
Index 30: Ground/Rock - Already used last time.
Index 31: Poison - Similar to index 1 and 20.
Index 32: Poison/Water - Combines poison and water.
Index 33: Fire - Another Fire, maybe not needed.
Index 34: Fairy - Similar to index 2.
Index 35: Normal/Poison - Good for normal and poison.
Index 36: Flying/Fight - Versatile with fight and flying.
Index 37: Bug/Ice - Combines bug and ice.
Index 38: Electric - Strong electric moves.
Index 39: Steel - Good defensive type.
Index 40: Fight - Similar to index 12 and 25.
Index 41: Ground/Fight - Combines ground and fight.
Index 42: Ice/Fight - Combines ice and fight.
Index 43: Flying/Fire - Similar to index 6 and 28.
Index 44: Flying - Strong flying moves.
Index 45: Bug/Dark - Combines bug and dark.
Index 46: Dark/Flying - Combines dark and flying.
Index 47: Bug - More bug moves.
Index 48: Ice - Already used last time.

Looking at the types needed, maybe adding a Water type would help since they had Water in their previous team but perhaps not enough coverage. Also, having multiple types that cover different weaknesses could improve their chances.

Considering their last loss, maybe their team was weak against certain types or moves. If the opponent had strong Water Pokémon, having more Water resistances or attacks might be beneficial.

I should pick three Pokémon with complementary types and strong moves. Maybe one Fire, one Ground, and one Water type to cover offense and defense.

Looking at index 0: Fire - High HP, good attacker.
Index 5: Ground - Solid defensive moves.
Index 11: Water - Strong Water moves.

Alternatively, maybe include a Dragon for its high HP and multi-type coverage. Index 3: Dragon has Water and Electric moves, which could be useful against certain opponents.

Another option is index 4: Electric/Water. This Pokémon can cover both types, providing versatility.

So, considering the previous team's loss, perhaps they need better coverage in specific areas. Maybe their last team had trouble with certain types or moves, so choosing Pokémon that counter those would help.

In this case, I think selecting indices 0 (Fire), 5 (Ground), and 11 (Water) could provide a good balance of offensive and defensive capabilities, as well as type coverage.
</think>

To improve their chances after the loss, they need a team with strong defensive and offensive types. They should avoid using the same types as before if those contributed to the loss.

After evaluating each Pokémon's strengths and weaknesses, here’s the new team:

---0, 5, 11---

These indices provide a balance of Fire, Ground, and Water types, offering versatile coverage for different battle scenarios.

Alright, so I need to help build a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The user's last team won, so they probably want another strong team. Let me start by analyzing the problem step by step.

First, the previous team indices were [0, 5, 11]. Looking back at the Roster:

- Index 0 is Fire type with decent HP and moves.
- Index 5 is Ground type with decent stats.
- Index 11 is Water type with good moves including Rock and Electric, which are strong against many types.

Since they won last time, maybe their team composition was effective. Now, I need to choose three different indices that can potentially be stronger or cover different weaknesses.

Looking at the Roster, I should consider each Pokémon's type, HP, and moves. Maybe pick types that are strong against common enemies or have good coverage.

For example:

- Index 14: Ghost/Fire. Ghost is good against Dark and Ground, while Fire is versatile.
- Index 30: Ground/Rock. Rock is great for neutralizing many types, and Ground can support with STAB moves.
- Index 49: Ice. Ice is strong against Grass and Water, which are common types in the Roster.

Alternatively:

- Maybe include Electric or Dragon types for added versatility, but I'm not sure if they're better than the current choices.

Wait, let me think about their move sets. The previous team had a Water Pokémon with Rock moves, so maybe having another Ground type would provide good coverage. Fire is also a solid choice because it's strong against Grass and Water.

Also, considering the types that are not too common in the Roster might be beneficial. For instance, Ghost can handle Dark and Ground types effectively.

I should check each Pokémon's moves to ensure they have access to strong moves. Let me verify:

- Index 14: Ghost/Fire. Moves include Trickroom and Change Type, which can be useful.
- Index 30: Ground/Rock. Rock moves are strong against many types.
- Index 49: Ice. Good for Grass and Water resistance.

This combination seems balanced with coverage against multiple types. I think this would give the user a good chance in their next battle.

Okay, so I need to help this user build a new Pokémon team based on the given data. Let's see what they've provided.

First, the user mentioned it's their first battle, so there's no prior result or previous team. That means they're starting fresh. The goal is to maximize their chances in the next battle by selecting three Pokémon from the roster.

Looking at the Roster, each entry has a Type, Max_HP, and Moves. I need to choose three that can potentially win against whatever they'll be facing next. Since there's no prior data, I should consider which types are strong overall or have versatile moves that can handle different opponents.

Let me go through some of the higher Max_HP Pokémon because higher HP can mean better survivability. For example, indices 35 and 36 have high HP but also some specific moves. Index 35 is Ground with access to FROZEN, which could be useful if the opponent uses certain types. However, since it's their first battle, maybe they don't know what they'll face yet.

Index 30 caught my eye because it has Electric and Normal types, which are versatile. Electric can handle a lot of types, and Normal is solid all-around. Plus, it has moves like FROZEN and DRAGON, which could be useful in different situations.

Another strong candidate is index 49, a Normal/Grass type with high HP. Normal is great against many types, and Grass provides coverage against certain moves or types. It also has Target Boosts, which can boost the effectiveness of moves.

I'm also thinking about balance. They need a mix of offense, defense, and utility. For example, Electric (index 30) can deal with both physical and special attacks, Normal/Grass (49) covers a lot of ground, and maybe a Ground type for terrain control or defensive moves. Index 35 is a solid choice because it's Ground with FROZEN, which can boost the effectiveness against certain types.

Wait, but the user wants to maximize their chances. So perhaps having an Electric type is good because it's strong against many others and can handle both physical and special attacks. Normal/Grass gives them a strong defensive presence and versatility. And Ground adds more defense and terrain control.

Alternatively, index 35 might be too bulky, but maybe that's beneficial for survivability. However, without knowing the opponent, I should aim for types that are generally strong against others.

I think the best approach is to select three Pokémon with strong overall stats, good type coverage, and useful moves. So, probably:

- Index 30: Electric/Normal for versatility.
- Index 35: Ground for defense and FROZEN.
- Index 49: Normal/Grass for additional Normal coverage and Target Boosts.

This combination should provide a well-rounded team that can handle various opponents and adapt to different strategies.

Alright, so I need to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, the user has provided a list of 50 Pokémon templates with their types, Max HP, and moves. They also mentioned that their last team won, with Elo increased to 1215. The previous team used indices [30, 35, 49]. The task is to select a new team of three Pokémon from this roster.

My goal is to maximize the chances of winning the next battle. To do this, I should consider factors like each Pokémon's type effectiveness against others, their moves' power and accuracy, and how they complement each other in a team.

Let me look at the previous team: indices 30, 35, 49.

- Index 30: Type is ELECTRIC/NORMAL. It has Ghost, Dragon, etc.
- Index 35: Ground type with moves like Psychic, Fire, etc.
- Index 49: Normal/Grass with Water, Dark, etc.

So their last team was a mix of Electric/Normal, Ground, and Normal/Grass. They won, so maybe the synergy among these types worked well.

Now, I need to pick three new Pokémon that can cover types that would be effective against whatever the opponent might throw at. Since I don't know the opponent's team, it's safer to choose a versatile team that can handle multiple types.

Looking through the roster, I should look for Pokémon with strong offensive moves, good defensive stats (HP), and type coverage. Also, considering status moves or immunities could be beneficial.

Let me go through each template:

Starting from index 0:
- Type Normal/Ghost: Good HP, has Flying, Physical moves. Could support as a tank.

Index 1: Psychic. High accuracy moves, but lower HP.

Index 2: Electric/Bug. Good move set, high HP.

Index 3: Bug/Fairy. Not sure about this one.

Index 4: Ground/Ghost. Tanky with ground moves.

Index5: Dark. High HP, good special moves.

Index6: Dragon. High HP and moves, but maybe not the best for team synergy.

Index7: Normal/Ghost. Similar to index0.

Index8: Flying. High speed, but low HP.

Index9: Psychic. High PP, good moves.

Index10: Ghost. Tanky with good moves.

Index11: Grass. Good PP, but might be weak against certain types.

Index12: Ground/Steel. Tanky, good defensive moves.

Index13: Ghost. Another tank option.

Index14: Dark/Fairy. Interesting mix.

Index15: Fire/Steel. High HP, good move set.

Index16: Water. High HP, good moves but maybe not the best for team.

Index17: Electric/Fight. Good PP and moves.

Index18: Steel. Tanky with good accuracy.

Index19: Dragon. Similar to index6.

Index20: Bug/Psychic. Good move set.

Index21: Steel/Ice. Tanky, but maybe not as strong as others.

Index22: Psychic. Lower HP but good moves.

Index23: Fairy. High HP, good moves.

Index24: Bug. Not sure.

Index25: Rock. Tanky with strong moves.

Index26: Electric/Grass. Good PP.

Index27: Fire/Ice. High HP and moves.

Index28: Bug. Maybe not the best for team.

Index29: Ghost. Tanky, good moves.

Index30: Already used before.

Index31: Fairy/Rock. Interesting mix.

Index32: Dark/Rock. Good type coverage.

Index33: Grass/Water. Covers multiple types.

Index34: Dragon. Similar to others.

Index35: Used before.

Index36: Rock. Tanky, good moves.

Index37: Flying. High PP and speed.

Index38: Rock/Fairy. Mixed types.

Index39: Psychic/Electric. Good move set.

Index40: Poison. High HP and moves.

Index41: Rock. Similar to others.

Index42: Dark/Fire. Good type coverage.

Index43: Rock/Grass. Mixed types.

Index44: Rock/Steel. Tanky with good moves.

Index45: Bug. Maybe not the best.

Index46: Water. Similar to index16.

Index47: Dark. High HP, good moves.

Index48: Water. Similar again.

Index49: Used before.

Now, considering that the previous team had ELECTRIC/NORMAL (30), GROUND (35), and NORMAL/GRASS (49). So they covered Electric, Ground, Grass, Normal types.

To counter a potential opponent, maybe it's good to have coverage against Electric, Ground, and other common types. Alternatively, having strong offensive Pokémon that can deal with multiple types.

I think choosing Pokémon that can cover multiple types or have strong moves would be beneficial. For example, Dark type has access to Toxic and other strong moves. Rock has STS, which is useful. Ghost can handle status moves.

Looking for high HP tanks to survive and support the team. Also, having a mix of attackers and supporters.

Let me pick three that complement each other:

1. Index 35: Ground type with good moves. Can cover ground and have high HP.
2. Index 44: Rock/Steel. Tanky with STS and other good moves.
3. Index 47: Dark. High HP, has access to Toxic, which is a strong move.

Alternatively, maybe index35 (Ground), index45 (Bug) isn't great. Or index35, index20 (Bug/Psychic). Wait, index20 is Bug/Psychic with good moves.

Wait, perhaps:

- Index 35: Ground for STS and defensive.
- Index 44: Rock/Steel for STS and coverage.
- Index 40: Poison, which has high HP and strong moves.

Alternatively, maybe index35 (Ground), index20 (Bug/Psychic), and index47 (Dark).

But I need to check their types:

- Ground covers ground, can handle poison, etc.
- Bug can deal with grass and other bugs.
- Dark is good for dealing with Psychic and others.

Wait, but the previous team had Ground, so maybe adding another type like Electric or Rock would be better. Alternatively, choosing strong attackers.

Looking at index45: Bug, which has STS and other moves. But if I pick Bug, it might not cover as much.

Alternatively, index44 (Rock/Steel) covers Steel and Rock, which are good for defense and attack.

I think a good combination would be:

1. Ground type for defensive coverage.
2. Rock/Steel for STS and solid defense.
3. Dark type for offensive moves and status resistance.

So indices 35 (Ground), 44 (Rock/Steel), and 47 (Dark).

Alternatively, maybe index35 (Ground), index44 (Rock/Steel), and index20 (Bug/Psychic). Wait, Bug can handle grass and other types.

But considering the previous team had ELECTRIC/NORMAL, GROUND, NORMAL/GRASS. So opponent might have Electric or Grass types. Therefore, adding Dark and Rock would cover more bases.

Another approach: choose the three highest HP Pokémon to maximize survivability. The top are 35 (160), 44 (152), 49 (155). But they might not all be needed.

Alternatively, pick high HP with good moves.

Wait, let me think about the moves each has:

- Index35: Ground type, has STS? Let me check: yes, it has MISTY_TERRAIN and FROZEN, but no STS. Wait, looking at index35's move list: No, it has MISTY_TERRAIN, FIRE, etc., but no STS.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each:

- Index35: Ground type with moves that include MISTY_TERRAIN and FROZEN, but not STS.
- Index44: Rock/Steel with STS move.
- So perhaps having index44 is better for STS.

So maybe team of 35 (Ground), 44 (Rock/Steel), and 40 (Poison). But I don't know if that's the best.

Alternatively, pick:

1. Ground (index35): High HP, good moves including MISTY_TERRAIN.
2. Rock/Steel (index44): STS, high HP.
3. Dark (index47): High HP, strong moves like Toxic.

This way, they cover Ground, Rock, and Dark types, which can handle various threats.

Alternatively, maybe include a Psychic type for resistance to certain moves.

Wait, but the previous team had Normal/Grass, so perhaps opponent might have Psychic or Electric. So having a Dark type with Ignore Evasion (index47) could be useful against Psychic attacks.

So, I think the best team is:

- 35: Ground for defensive and MISTY_TERRAIN.
- 44: Rock/Steel for STS and defense.
- 40: Poison for high HP and strong moves.

But index40's type is Poison. So types covered: Ground, Rock, Poison.

Alternatively, maybe add a Ghost type to handle status moves, but I don't have one in the new team.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Index35 (Ground)
2. Index44 (Rock/Steel)
3. Index47 (Dark)

This gives coverage against Ground, Rock, and Dark types, which can help against various opponents.

Another consideration: the last result was a win, so maybe being aggressive is good.

Alternatively, picking strong attackers:

- 20: Bug/Psychic with high PP moves.
- 35: Ground for defense.
- 44: Rock/Steel for STS.

But I need to pick three.

Wait, perhaps the best is:

1. Index35 (Ground)
2. Index44 (Rock/Steel)
3. Index47 (Dark)

Yes, that seems balanced with good coverage and high HP.

Alternatively, if I want more offensive power, maybe index30 (Electric/Normal) for Electric moves and Normal coverage, but it's part of the previous team.

Wait, let me check the previous team: [30,35,49]. So 30 is Electric/Normal. Maybe avoid using it again unless necessary.

So perhaps go with 35,44,47.

Another thought: if I can get a team that has STS (index44), MISTY_TERRAIN (index35), and maybe something else.

But I need to pick three.

Alternatively, let's see which Pokémon have high HP and strong moves:

- Index35: 160 HP, Ground type with some good moves.
- Index44: 152 HP, Rock/Steel with STS.
- Index49: 155 HP, Normal/Grass. But maybe not the best for this matchup.

Alternatively, index30 is Electric/Normal with high HP (156). So perhaps:

1. Index30: Electric/Normal
2. Index35: Ground
3. Index44: Rock/Steel

This would give coverage of Electric, Ground, and Rock/Steel.

But 30 was part of the previous team. I don't know if that matters; maybe it's better to have different types.

Alternatively, perhaps a mix of types for coverage.

I think the key is to pick Pokémon with high HP and useful moves like STS or MISTY_TERRAIN, along with coverage against common type effectiveness.

So, after considering all this, I'll go with:

35 (Ground), 44 (Rock/Steel), and 47 (Dark).

Wait, but index47 is Dark. So types covered: Ground, Rock, Dark.

Yes, that's a good combination.

Okay, so I need to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster to choose next. The previous team had indices [35, 44, 47], and they won last time with an Elo of 1231.29. Now, my goal is to select a new team that can maximize their chances in the next battle.

First, I should look at each Pokémon's type because types can determine which moves are effective against others. The previous team's indices were 35, 44, and 47. Let me check what types those correspond to.

Looking through the roster:
- Index 35: Ground type.
- Index 44: Rock/Steel type.
- Index 47: Dark type.

So their last team had a Ground, Rock/Steel, and Dark type Pokémon. That gives them coverage against various types, which is good for balanced defense.

Now, I need to consider the next battle. Without knowing the opponent's type or exact moves, it's tricky, but I can try to balance the team as well. The key is to choose Pokémon that have strong defensive stats, useful moves, and maybe some offensive capabilities.

Looking through the roster again:

- Index 0: Normal/Ghost with high max HP and useful moves like Flying and Dragon.
- Index 1: Psychic with decent moves, but lower HP.
- Index 2: Electric/Bug with good HP and a variety of moves.
- Index 3: Bug/Fairy with high HP and strong physical moves.
- Index 4: Ground/Ghost, which is similar to index 35, but maybe not needed if we already have Ground.
- Index 5: Dark, could be useful for defensive purposes or against certain types.
- Index 6: Dragon, has good special attacks but lower HP.
- Index 7: Normal/Ghost again, similar to index 0.
- Index 8: Flying, which is a good offensive type with high PP.
- Index 9: Psychic, another useful type with decent moves.
- Index 10: Ghost, which can be good for resistances.
- Index 11: Grass, but without knowing the opponent's type, it might not be as essential.
- Index 12: Ground/Steel, similar to index 44, provides both types.
- Index 13: Ghost again.
- Index 14: Dark/Fairy, which combines two offensive types.
- Index 15: Fire/Steel, useful for fire resistance and steel defense.
- Index 16: Water, good for water resistances but maybe not necessary unless the opponent is water.
- Index 17: Electric/Fight, has high HP and strong physical moves.
- Index 18: Steel, which can help with defense against steel attacks.
- Index 19: Dragon again.
- Index 20: Bug/Psychic, good for bug resistances and psychic boosts.
- Index 21: Steel/Ice, useful for ice resistance and steel defense.
- Index 22: Psychic again.
- Index 23: Fairy, another offensive type with high HP.
- Index 24: Bug, similar to index 3 but perhaps different moves.
- Index 25: Rock, good for rock resistances and solid defense.
- Index 26: Electric/Grass, covers two types and has good PP.
- Index 27: Fire/Ice, useful for fire and ice resistance.
- Index 28: Bug again.
- Index 29: Ghost, similar to others.
- Index 30: Electric/Normal, covers both types with decent moves.
- Index 31: Fairy/Rock, combines fairy and rock resistances.
- Index 32: Dark/Rock, good for dark resistances and rock defense.
- Index 33: Grass/Water, useful if the opponent is water or grass.
- Index 34: Dragon again.
- Index 35: Ground again, already used in previous team.
- Index 36: Rock, similar to index 44.
- Index 37: Flying again.
- Index 38: Rock/Fairy, another rock and fairy combination.
- Index 39: Psychic/Electric, useful for psychic and electric resistances.
- Index 40: Poison, good against poison types but not sure if necessary.
- Index 41: Rock again.
- Index 42: Dark/Fire, covers dark and fire.
- Index 43: Rock/Grass, similar to others.
- Index 44: Rock/Steel, already used in previous team.
- Index 45: Bug again.
- Index 46: Water again.
- Index 47: Dark, already used in previous team.

So, the previous team had Ground (35), Rock/Steel (44), and Dark (47). The new team needs to cover as many types as possible without overlapping too much. Maybe include another Ghost or Normal for better coverage. Let's see:

Looking at index 0: Normal/Ghost with high HP and good moves. It can help against ghost types and provide normal resistance.

Index 30: Electric/Normal, which covers both types and has some good moves like Dragon and FROZEN.

Index 49: Normal/Grass with high HP and good resistances. It could add grass resistance and normal defense.

Alternatively, index 31: Fairy/Rock, which adds fairy and rock resistance.

Wait, but the previous team had Rock/Steel (44), so maybe adding another rock type isn't necessary unless we want more coverage. Alternatively, adding a Fairy type for fairy resistances.

But considering their last victory and Elo, perhaps choosing strong defensive Pokémon would be better. Let me check each Pokémon's max HP:

Index 0: 112
Index 3: 58 (low)
Index 35: 160 (high)
Index 44: 152 (very high)
Index 47: 137 (high)
Index 30: 156 (very high)
Index 49: 155 (almost as high as 30)

So, indices with the highest HP are 35, 44, 47, 30, and 49. But we can't have more than three.

If I pick index 0 for Normal/Ghost (HP 112), index 30 for Electric/Normal (156), and index 49 for Normal/Grass (155). That gives a strong team with high HPs across different types.

Alternatively, if I want to include Dark again but have higher HPs: index 5 is Dark with Max HP 160. So maybe 35 (Ground), 44 (Rock/Steel), and 47 (Dark) are all still viable, but perhaps adding a Ghost type for better coverage, like index 0 or 29.

Wait, the previous team had Ground, Rock/Steel, Dark. Adding a Ghost would cover more types without overlapping. So maybe pick index 0 (Normal/Ghost) instead of another type.

So possible team: 35 (Ground), 44 (Rock/Steel), and 0 (Normal/Ghost). But let me check the types:

- Ground covers ground
- Rock/Steel covers rock, steel, maybe some others
- Normal/Ghost covers normal, ghost

But what about Electric or other types? Maybe it's better to include an Electric type for coverage.

Alternatively, index 30 is Electric/Normal, which would add electric and normal. So combining that with Ground and Rock/Steel might be good.

Wait, but the previous team had Dark (47), so maybe it's better to have a different setup.

Alternatively, pick the three highest HPs: 35 (160), 44 (152), 30 (156). That gives Ground, Rock/Steel, Electric/Normal. But does that cover all types? Not sure if there are overlapping resistances.

But since the previous team won with those indices, perhaps sticking with similar strong Pokemon is good.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Ghost type for better coverage.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. The goal is to maximize chances in next battle. So we need a team that can cover as many types as possible and has strong moves.

Looking at each Pokémon's moves:

Index 0: Has Normal and Ghost moves. Good resistances.
Index 30: Electric/Normal, with Dragon and FROZEN.
Index 35: Ground, with Psyche and others.
Index 44: Rock/Steel, with Flying and others.
Index 47: Dark, with Ice and Electro.

Wait, but the previous team was [35,44,47], which is Ground, Rock/Steel, Dark. So if I need to change one for better coverage or higher HP.

Looking at index 0 (Normal/Ghost): Normal and Ghost resistances. If we include this, we can cover more types.

Alternatively, index 30: Electric/Normal with Dragon and FROZEN.

So perhaps the new team could be [35,44,30]. But let me see:

- 35: Ground
- 44: Rock/Steel
- 30: Electric/Normal

This covers Ground, Rock, Steel, Electric, Normal. Maybe good coverage.

Alternatively, including a Ghost for better type coverage.

Wait, but the previous team had Dark (47). So if I replace 47 with someone else, like index 0 or 30.

But the user's last result was a win. The previous team was [35,44,47]. To get another winning team, maybe keep two of them and add someone strong.

Looking at the HPs:

35:160
44:152
47:137
So perhaps replace 47 with a higher HP type. But 30 has 156 which is lower than 35 but higher than others.

Alternatively, pick index 0 (112), which is lower, but it's Normal/Ghost which might be useful.

Wait, no. We need to choose indices from the given list. So perhaps:

- Keep 35 and 44.
- Replace 47 with someone else.

Looking at other indices for Dark type: 47 has Max HP 137, which is decent, but maybe a different type would be better.

Alternatively, pick index 30 (Electric/Normal) to add another type.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to select the three highest HP Pokémon that can cover multiple types effectively.

Looking at all the templates:

HPs:
35:160
44:152
30:156
31:148
34:131
32:109
...

So 35,44,30 have the top three HPs. So maybe selecting those would be a good strategy to maximize future chances.

But also considering their types and moves.

- 35: Ground type. Moves include Psychic, Misty TERRAIN, Fire, etc.
- 44: Rock/Steel. Moves include Flying, Rock, etc.
- 30: Electric/Normal. Moves include Ghost, Dragon, FROZEN.

This combination covers a lot of types and has high HPs.

Alternatively, maybe including a Ghost type for better coverage.

But I think the main goal is to have strong Pokemon with good moves that can handle various types.

So considering all this, the top three by HP are 35,44,30. So perhaps that's the team.

Alright, let's try to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. So, from what I understand, I need to select three Pokémon from the provided roster in such a way that they maximize my chances of winning the next battle. 

First, I should consider what the previous successful team was. The user mentioned that the last team won with indices [30, 35, 44]. So, maybe analyzing those Pokémon can give me insights into what worked well before.

Looking at the types of these Pokémon: index 30 is Electric/Normal, 35 is Ground, and 44 is Rock/Steel. That's a mix of different types which could provide coverage against various opponents. Now, I need to see if there are other combinations that might be as effective or better.

I should also think about the moves each Pokémon has because effective moves can make a big difference in battles. For example, Ground-type Pokémon often have moves like Earthquake which are strong physically. Rock/Steel types might have moves like Stone Edge or Rock Smash, which are physical and can be quite powerful.

Looking through the roster again, I should try to find other Pokémon that complement each other's strengths. Maybe adding a Flying type for coverage against certain types, or a Psychic for support moves. Alternatively, maybe another Electric type could pair well with Normal for coverage.

I also need to consider the Max HP and accuracy of their moves because higher HP can mean more survivability, which is crucial in battle. Accurate moves can make or break a match, so I should focus on Pokémon with high accuracy.

Another thing to think about is the previous team's composition. The last team had Ground (35), which is a solid physical type, Normal/Electric (30), which covers both Electric and Normal types, and Rock/Steel (44) for rock moves and Steel defense. Maybe I can find another set with similar coverage but better stats.

Let me look at the other indices. For example, index 49 is Normal/Grass. That could be a good addition because Grass can provide some utility with moves like Razor Leaf or Sunflower Seed, which might help in certain situations. It also has Normal type, which pairs well with Electric.

Wait, if I include index 30 (Electric/Normal), that's already covering Electric and Normal. Maybe instead of 35 (Ground) and 44 (Rock/Steel), I could replace them with other types that provide different coverage but similar effectiveness.

Looking at index 37: FLYING. Flying can cover against Fighting, Bugging, etc., which might be useful. Its moves include Bug and Ground, but maybe it's better to have a mix of types.

Alternatively, index 14 is Dark/Fairy. Dark is good for resistances and Fairy can be strong against Dragon types. Maybe that's a good addition alongside Electric/Normal.

Wait, the previous team was [30,35,44]. So if I want to keep 30 (Electric/Normal) as a base, perhaps find two others that complement it without overlapping too much.

Looking at index 14: Dark/Fairy. It can provide coverage against Dragon types and have some strong moves like Dark Pulse or Fairy Wind. That might be a good addition.

Another option is index 49: Normal/Grass. It's another Normal type, which could help with Electric moves, but also adds Grass for support.

Alternatively, maybe index 26: Electric/Grass. That would add both types again but perhaps different coverage.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list out the types of the previous team:

- 30: Electric/Normal
- 35: Ground
- 44: Rock/Steel

So they cover Normal, Electric, Ground, and Rock/Steel. Maybe I can find another set that covers similar or different types but with better stats.

Looking at index 14: Dark/Fairy. It adds Dark type, which is good for resistances against Fighting and Bug, and Fairy, which is strong against Dragon. That could be useful.

If I include 30, 14, and maybe 49 (Normal/Grass), that would give me Normal, Electric from 30; Dark and Fairy from 14; Normal again from 49. Wait, but 49 is Normal/Grass. So Normal is covered twice, which isn't a problem, but Grass adds another type.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing 26 (Electric/Grass) instead of 49 might provide better coverage with Electric and Grass.

I need to make sure the moves complement each other as well. For example, if I have two Electric types, their moves could stack or provide more coverage.

Wait, but 30 is Electric/Normal and 26 is Electric/Grass, so together they cover Electric, Normal, and Grass. Then adding a Dark/Fairy (14) would add Dark and Fairy. That seems like solid coverage.

Alternatively, maybe including index 44 (Rock/Steel) again instead of 14 could provide more Rock moves. But then I'd have two Normal/Electric types, which might be redundant.

I think the key is to find three Pokémon that together cover a wide range of types and have strong moves. Maybe the previous team's success can guide me towards similar compositions but with different types.

Another approach is to look for high Max HP and good accuracy. For example, index 30 has Max HP 156 and some strong moves like Dragon Dance or Thunderbolt. That's a solid choice.

Looking at index 35: Ground type with high Max HP (160) and strong Earthquake move. It's a reliable physical attacker.

Index 44: Rock/Steel with Max HP 152 and Stone Edge, which is a powerful physical move. That's another strong addition.

If I need to replace two of these, perhaps find other types that can cover similar roles. For example, instead of Ground and Rock/Steel, maybe add Dark/Fairy (14) for coverage against Dragon types and some resistances, and another Electric/Normal (30). But then 30 is already in the previous team.

Wait, no, the user's last message says "Your last team won" so they can use any three from the roster, including possibly overlapping types with the previous team. So maybe it's okay to have multiple same-type Pokémon as long as their moves are effective.

But I should also consider that having more of the same type could be a problem if the opponent has similar weaknesses. For example, having two Electric types might not add much if the opponent already struggles against Electric.

Alternatively, having three different types can provide better coverage and versatility.

I think I need to focus on selecting Pokémon with strong individual stats and complementary types. Maybe looking for high Max HP, good accuracy, and a mix of types that can handle various opponents.

Looking again at index 44: Rock/Steel with high HP and strong moves like Stone Edge. That's a solid choice.

Index 35: Ground type with Earthquake, which is a powerful move. Good.

Index 30: Electric/Normal with Thunderbolt and Dragon Dance. Also strong.

So if I have to pick three, perhaps 30, 35, 44 is the same as the previous team. But maybe there are better options now.

Wait, but the user said "your last team won" so they can include similar Pokémon or different ones.

But maybe the opponent has changed their type coverage, so it's better to have a fresh team.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's instruction is to choose any three from the roster regardless of prior choices.

So I should consider which three from 0-49 will maximize the chances based on Roster and last result.

But without knowing the exact opponent's types or moves, it's tricky. So the best approach is to select the top-tier Pokémon in terms of Max HP and move power.

Looking at the Max HP:

- Index 35: 160
- Index 44: 152
- Index 30: 156
- Index 20: 133
- Index 25: 132
- Index 33:144
- Index 34:131
- Index 37:117
- etc.

So the top three are 35 (160), 30 (156), 44 (152). If I have to choose, those might be strong choices.

But their types:

- 35: Ground
- 30: Electric/Normal
- 44: Rock/Steel

That covers a lot of ground. But maybe including Dark/Fairy (14) would add more coverage against Dragon types and resistances.

Alternatively, if I include 26 (Electric/Grass), that adds Grass type which can handle Poison or other Grass moves.

But without knowing the opponent's weaknesses, it's hard to say.

Perhaps the best approach is to stick with high HP and strong moves. So maybe go for 30,35,44 again, but perhaps replace one with a better fit.

Alternatively, considering that in the previous battle, those indices won, maybe keep them if they work.

But since the user says "maximize your chances," perhaps trying to include more versatile or stronger Pokémon is better.

Looking at index 49: Normal/Grass, Max HP 155. It has moves like Water and Dragon. Maybe that could provide good coverage.

Alternatively, index 20: Bug/Psychic with high Max HP (133) and strong moves like FIGHT and Steel. That's another solid choice.

I think the key is to pick the three highest Max HP Pokémon that also have strong moves across different types.

Looking at the Roster:

- Index 35: Ground, 160
- Index 44: Rock/Steel, 152
- Index 30: Electric/Normal, 156
- Index 20: Bug/Psychic, 133
- Index 25: Rock, 132
- Index 33: Grass/Water, 144
- Index 34: Dragon,131
- Index 26: Electric/Grass,98

So the top three are 35,44,30. But perhaps replacing one with a different type might be better.

If I replace index 35 (Ground) with index 14 (Dark/Fairy), then have:

30 (Electric/Normal), 44 (Rock/Steel), 14 (Dark/Fairy). That adds more type coverage.

Alternatively, if Ground is needed for Earthquake which is very strong, perhaps keeping 35 is better.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard. So maybe go with the highest HP and good moves.

So possibly, pick 30,35,44 again.

Wait, but in the previous team, they were [30,35,44], which won. Maybe using them again is fine.

Alternatively, check if other combinations have better synergy.

Looking at index 20: Bug/Psychic has FIGHT and Steel moves, which are strong.

If I pick 20 instead of someone else.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's a guessing game.

Another approach: look for Pokémon with high Max HP, multiple types, and strong moves across different categories (Physical, Special, etc.)

Looking at index 49: Normal/Grass. It has Water, Dragon, and other moves. Maybe good.

Index 30: Electric/Normal. Has Ghost, Dragon, etc.

But perhaps the best is to go with the top three HP:35,44,30.

So return ---35,44,30--- as the new team.

Wait, but the previous team used these indices last time and won, so maybe they are a good fit again.

The last battle was won with the team of indices [30, 35, 44]. These Pokémon have high Max HP and strong moves across various types. Reusing them might provide consistent performance.

Okay, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what they've provided.

First, the user has a list of 50 Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves. Then, there's the previous team indices: [30, 35, 44]. Also, the last result says the last team won with an Elo of 1268.08. 

I remember that in this simplified Pokémon game, each Pokémon has certain moves that can be used in battle. The goal is to pick three Pokémon that have the highest chance of winning the next battle. Since they won last time, maybe keeping some of those Pokémon could help, but perhaps there's a better combination.

Looking at the previous team, all three are strong Pokémon. Let me check their types and moves. 

PkmTemplate 30: Type ELECTRIC/NORMAL, Max_HP=156, Moves include GHOST, Light Screen, DRAGON, etc.
PkmTemplate 35: Type GROUND, Max_HP=160, Moves like PSYCHIC, FROZEN, GROUND, etc.
PkmTemplate 44: Type ROCK/STEEL, Max_HP=152, Moves include FLYING, ROCK, WATER, etc.

These are all pretty strong. But maybe there's a better combination available in the roster. I need to look for Pokémon that have strong moves against common types or have high accuracy and power.

I should also consider team synergy—maybe having a mix of types like Electric, Rock, and Grass could cover multiple weaknesses. Alternatively, maybe adding a Dragon or Dark type could be useful.

Looking through the roster, I see some strong candidates. For example, PkmTemplate 14 is Dark/Fairy with high moves like Dragon, which can be good against Fairy types. PkmTemplate 30 is already in the previous team but is quite strong.

I also notice that some Pokémon have moves that boost their own stats, like self boosts or accuracy. Maybe including a Pokémon with self boosts could help the team overall.

Wait, maybe I should compare each of the previous team members to see if there's a better option. PkmTemplate 30 has ELECTRIC/NORMAL, which is versatile. But perhaps another Electric type could have better moves.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Ghost or Rock type would be good for coverage. PkmTemplate 44 is already Rock/Steel, so that covers Steel and Rock. Maybe replacing one of them with something that counters common enemies.

I should also consider the moves' accuracies and PP. High accuracy and long PP are better because they can chain attacks more effectively.

Looking at PkmTemplate 14 again: Dark/Fairy, with Dragon move—Dragon is strong against Fairy, which could be useful if the opponent has Fairy types. Also, Dark resists Ghost moves, which might be handy.

Another consideration is the Max HP of each Pokémon. Higher HP means better survivability, which can be important in long battles or against powerful opponents.

I should also think about type coverage. Having a mix of types that can cover multiple weaknesses would be advantageous. For example, Electric covers Electric and Normal, Rock/Steel covers those, and Dark/Fairy adds another layer.

Wait, but the user's last team won with [30, 35, 44], so maybe sticking close to similar types could maintain their winning streak. Alternatively, perhaps introducing a new type that they haven't used before could surprise the opponent.

I think I'll go through each of the previous team members and see if there's a better option in the roster for each slot.

For index 30: ELECTRIC/NORMAL. Maybe another Electric type with similar or better stats? Let me look through the list. PkmTemplate 26 is Electric/Grass, but Max HP is 98 which is lower than 156. PkmTemplate 17 is Electric/Fight, with higher PP but same HP as 30? No, 30 has higher max HP.

Alternatively, maybe a Normal type could be better. Let's see, PkmTemplate 0 is Normal/Ghost with high moves like Flying and Dragon. That might be a good alternative for Normal coverage.

For index 35: GROUND. Maybe another Ground type with similar or better stats? PkmTemplate 4 is Ground/Ghost with Max HP 113, which is less than 160. PkmTemplate 12 is Ground/Steel with lower HP as well. So maybe keeping 35 is good.

For index 44: ROCK/STEEL. Maybe another Steel type could be better. Let's see, PkmTemplate 41 is Rock with Max HP 126 and some strong moves. Alternatively, PkmTemplate 38 is Rock/Fairy, but I think 44 has higher max HP (152) compared to others.

So perhaps replacing one of the previous indices with a more powerful or synergistic Pokémon could improve their chances.

Looking at PkmTemplate 14: Dark/Fairy with Max HP 92 and strong moves like Dragon. Maybe adding this would provide a new type and better synergy.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Ghost type to cover more types. PkmTemplate 0 is Normal/Ghost, which already has some good moves.

I think the best approach is to choose Pokémon that have high max HP, strong moves, and cover different types for coverage. So perhaps selecting [14, 30, 44] as the new team, replacing one of them with a better option if available.

Wait, in the previous team, they used [30,35,44]. If I can find three that are stronger or provide better synergy, that would be better.

Looking again, PkmTemplate 14 has Dark/Fairy, which could help against Fairy opponents and provide Dark coverage. Also, Dark resists Ghost moves, which is useful.

So maybe the new team should include PkmTemplate 14 to add Dark type, along with 30 (Electric/Normal) for versatility and 44 (Rock/Steel) for solid types. This would give a mix of Electric, Normal, Rock, Steel, and Dark coverage.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Dragon or Fairy type could be more effective. But considering their last team's success, perhaps sticking close to similar types with higher HP is better.

I think the optimal choice would be [14, 30, 44]. Let me double-check the stats:

- PkmTemplate 14: Max HP 92, which is lower than some others, but has strong moves like Dragon and high accuracy.
- PkmTemplate 30: High max HP (156) and good moves.
- PkmTemplate 44: Highest max HP at 152 with strong Rock/Steel moves.

This combination seems solid with good coverage and decent HP. It might be slightly weaker in HP than others, but the moves are powerful enough to compensate. Plus, having a Dark type adds more versatility against certain opponents.

Alright, I need to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team from the given roster based on the previous performance and the last result. The user provided that their last team won with an Elo of 1288.68, and the previous team indices were [14, 30, 44]. 

First, I should consider what made those three Pokémon effective. Without specific details on each Pokémon's abilities or how they performed, I'll have to make assumptions based on their types and stats. Generally, winning teams might consist of balanced types that can cover multiple weaknesses, strong individual stats, and moves that provide offensive or defensive advantages.

Looking at the roster, I need to evaluate each Pokémon's Type, Max_HP, and Moves to assess their potential in a battle. The goal is to pick three that can synergize well together, possibly covering different types (like Electric, Normal, etc.) and having high HP and strong moves.

Starting with index 14: It's a Dark/Fairy type with decent HP and some powerful moves like Dragon Dance and Toxic. It could be a good offensive choice.

Index 30: This is an Electric/Normal type with high Max_HP (156) and has Ghost, which can be useful for dealing with ghost types, along with other supportive moves like Light Screen.

Index 44: Rock/Steel type, which provides both defensive and offensive strengths. It has moves that can cover ground and water types, making it versatile in different battles.

I should check if these three can complement each other without overlapping too much. Electric/Normal (30) can support with Ghost resistance, while Dark/Fairy (14) can handle special attacks, and Rock/Steel (44) covers physical defense and offensive moves.

Considering their move sets: 30 has Light Screen which is good for team defense, 14 has Toxic which is great for control, and 44 has Rock which can break through defensive tactics. Their types also cover multiple elements, making them adaptable against different opponents.

I don't see any immediate conflicts or weaknesses in this combination. They seem balanced and capable of handling a variety of opponents.

Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who is playing a simplified Pokémon game. They need to build a new team based on their previous performance. Let me break down what they provided.

First, their last battle was successful because the last result says their Elo went up. Their previous team used indices 30, 14, and 44. Now, they're looking to choose three Pokémon from the given roster that will maximize their chances in the next match.

I should start by understanding the characteristics of each Pokémon in the new team. The user's goal is to select the best possible team, so I need to analyze which Pokémon have advantages against others or have high stats that could help them win.

Looking at the indices provided: 30, 14, and 44. Let me check what each of these corresponds to:

- Index 30: Type is ELECTRIC/NORMAL with Max_HP=156.
- Index 14: Type=DARK/FAIRY, Max_HP=92.
- Index 44: Type=ROCK/STEEL, Max_HP=152.

So the previous team had a mix of types that might have worked well together. Now, I need to find three more Pokémon from the roster that can complement each other and possibly counter any weaknesses the previous team might have had.

I should consider the strengths and weaknesses of each type in the new team. For example, if the last battle was against grass, having a strong rock or water type could be beneficial. Also, considering special moves and their accuracies will play a role.

Looking through the roster, I'll check for Pokémon with high HP, strong offensive moves, and types that can cover multiple vulnerabilities. Maybe adding a ghost type could help with resistances, or a fairy to boost certain stats.

I should also think about the previous team's types. The last team had Electric/Normal, Dark/Fairy, and Rock/Steel. So maybe adding another type that complements these, like grass for Rock/Steel weakness, or electric for support.

Wait, but the user wants a new team, not necessarily replacing the previous one. They might want to keep some of the same types if they worked well. However, since it's a simplified game, perhaps rotating certain Pokémon could help.

I need to ensure that each selected Pokémon has moves that can contribute effectively. For instance, having multiple physical attackers or a mix of special and physical types for coverage.

Let me go through the roster again:

- Index 0: Normal/Ghost
- Index 1: Psychic
- Index 2: Electric/Bug
- Index 3: Bug/Fairy
- Index 4: Ground/Ghost
- ... and so on.

I need to pick three that can work together. Maybe a strong physical attacker, a specialized type like fairy for boosts or resistances, and another type that covers a specific weakness.

Wait, the previous team had Rock/Steel, which is strong against grass and water. So maybe including a fairy could help with grass types. Alternatively, adding electric might support because of the previous team's Normal/Electric.

Hmm, perhaps selecting a Ghost type for resistances, a Fairy type for boosts or synergy, and a strong Electric/Normal type to cover multiple bases.

Looking back at index 30: Electric/Normal is already part of the previous team. Maybe not repeating it unless necessary. Alternatively, adding another Electric/Normal if they have better stats.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to choose any three from the roster, regardless of prior use. So maybe including a different type that can complement.

Let me consider the types:

- Electric and Normal: Good coverage.
- Dark/Fairy: Good for support or specific resistances.
- Rock/Steel: Good against grass and water.

Maybe adding a Psychic type would be good because it's strong against fighting types, which might be common in the roster. Or perhaps a Bug type for utility moves like toxic spikes.

Alternatively, adding another Fairy type could boost certain stats or provide elemental advantages. Or maybe a Ghost type to counter psychic attacks.

I think I need to look at each Pokémon's moves and see what they bring to the table. For example, if a Pokémon has high accuracy physical moves or strong special moves, that's valuable.

Let me check index 49: Normal/Grass. It has Water moves and some boosts. Maybe that could be useful against Rock/Steel from the previous team, as grass is weak against rock.

Alternatively, index 44 is Rock/Steel, so adding a fairy would resist rock. So maybe include a fairy type like index 3 or 23.

And then for the third Pokémon, perhaps a strong attacker, like index 45: Bug with high power moves.

Wait, but I need three. Let me think:

1. Index 30: Electric/Normal – solid all-rounder.
2. Index 44: Rock/Steel – counters grass/water and has good neutral stats.
3. Index 49: Normal/Grass – can handle some resistances and boost stats.

Alternatively, maybe replace one of them for a better fit.

Wait, the previous team used indices [30,14,44], so they are all part of the current roster. The user needs to choose three, but it's unclear if they can reuse any or must pick new ones. Since the instructions say "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster," I think repetition is allowed unless specified otherwise.

But in this case, maybe adding different types would be better. For example:

- Electric/Normal (index30)
- Dark/Fairy (index14)
- Rock/Steel (index44)

Alternatively, perhaps add a Ghost type for resistances and a Fairy for boosts.

Wait, let me check each move set:

Index 30: Electric/Normal has moves like Ghost, Dragon, etc. So it can handle some resistances.

Index 14: Dark/Fairy has good special moves and boosts.

Index44: Rock/Steel is solid against grass and water.

So maybe keeping these three makes sense because they cover multiple types and have strong individual stats.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a different type that complements them. For example, if the previous team was all physical, adding a special attacker could help.

But without knowing the exact opponents, it's hard to know what's needed. So I'll stick with the current indices since they seem to have good coverage and high stats.

Okay, so I need to help build a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, the user mentioned that their last team lost, and their Elo is 1304.18. They also noted that there was no past winning data available. So, my task is to choose three Pokémon from the Roster that will maximize their chances in the next battle.

Looking at the Roster, each Pokémon has a Type, Max HP, and various Moves with associated stats like Power, Accuracy, etc. The previous team used indices [30, 44, 49]. I wonder why those were chosen last time. Let me check what those Pokémon are:

- PkmTemplate 30: Type ELECTRIC/NORMAL, Max_HP=156
- PkmTemplate 44: Type ROCK/STEEL, Max_HP=152
- PkmTemplate 49: Type NORMAL/GRASS, Max_HP=155

So last time they used an Electric Normal, Rock Steel, and Normal Grass type combination. Maybe that was effective against the previous opponents?

Now, I need to choose three new Pokémon. Since their last team lost, perhaps they want a stronger or more synergistic team. Also, considering the types might help cover different weaknesses or strengths.

Looking through the Roster, I'll consider each Pokémon's Type and their moves' effectiveness. Maybe adding types that are strong against common enemies or have good defensive stats would be beneficial.

Let me go through some high Max HP options first, as higher HP can mean better survivability in battle.

PkmTemplate 35: Ground type with 160 HP and solid moves like psychic, fire, etc.
PkmTemplate 36: Rock type with 112 HP, water and fire moves.
PkmTemplate 37: Flying type with 117 HP, bug and ground moves.
PkmTemplate 38: Rock/Fairy with 114 HP, poison and electric moves.

Wait, but I need to balance types as well. Maybe having a mix of types that can cover each other's weaknesses.

Alternatively, maybe looking for strong offensive Pokémon with high Power and good Accuracies.

PkmTemplate 25: Rock type with 132 HP and powerful moves.
PkmTemplate 27: Fire/Ice with 139 HP, flying and electric moves.
PkmTemplate 34: Dragon type with 131 HP, fire and dark moves.

But I need to ensure the team isn't all attacking types without good defenses. Maybe including a ghost or fairy for support.

Looking at PkmTemplate 7: Normal/Ghost with 116 HP, ground and fight moves.
PkmTemplate 9: Psychic with 104 HP, bug and fire moves.

Wait, maybe combining high HP, strong offensive, and supportive types could work well.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon that can survive in long battles due to high Max PP (Max PP is the number of times a move can be used before it's lost). Higher Max PP means more uses per move, which can be good for strategies like sweeping through opponents.

PkmTemplate 2: Electric/Bug with 124 HP.
PkmTemplate 6: Dragon with 121 HP.
PkmTemplate 12: Ground/Steel with 56 HP.
PkmTemplate 17: Electric/Fight with 129 HP.
PkmTemplate 19: Dragon with 108 HP.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on a mix of types that are effective against each other. For example, having a Rock type to counter Ground, or a Water type for Fire and Grass.

Alternatively, considering the last team's types (Electric Normal, Rock Steel, Normal Grass), maybe this time they want to avoid duplicates unless necessary. Maybe choose different base types.

Wait, but without knowing the specific opponents, it's hard to tailor the team exactly. So I should pick the best possible options based on their stats.

Looking for high Max HP: 35 (Ground), 36 (Rock), 37 (Flying), 38 (Rock/Fairy), 30 (Electric/Normal), 44 (Rock/Steel), 49 (Normal/Grass).

Now, considering that the last team used Electric Normal, Rock Steel, and Normal Grass. Maybe adding a Ground type for coverage against Rock and others could be useful.

Alternatively, if they want to avoid Ground because of previous losses, maybe go for another type like Water or Psychic.

I think I'll aim to pick three Pokémon with good defensive stats, high HP, and moves that can contribute effectively in battle.

Looking again:

- PkmTemplate 35: Ground, strong moves, high HP.
- PkmTemplate 36: Rock, good defensive moves, decent HP.
- PkmTemplate 37: Flying, good offensive moves, moderate HP.

Alternatively, maybe a mix of types like Electric, Rock, and Dragon for variety.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating it. The user wants the team to maximize their chances, so perhaps selecting the highest Max HP Pokémon would be beneficial, as they can survive more battles.

Looking at the Roster, the highest Max HP are:

- 35: 160
- 36: 112
- 25: 132
- 30: 156
- 44: 152
- 49: 155

So choosing among these. Maybe picking 35 (Ground), 30 (Electric Normal), and 44 (Rock Steel) as they cover different types.

Wait, but the previous team already used similar types. Maybe to vary it, choose different types like Ground, Electric/Fighting, and Rock/Steel.

Alternatively, perhaps a more balanced approach with one strong attacker, one support, and one tank.

But without specific opponent info, I need to make a judgment based on overall stats.

I think the best choice would be:

1. PkmTemplate 35: Ground type with high HP (160) and strong moves.
2. PkmTemplate 30: Electric Normal with high HP (156) and good offensive/defensive moves.
3. PkmTemplate 44: Rock Steel with high HP (152) and solid defensive stats.

Alternatively, including a Ghost type for support, like PkmTemplate 7 or 29.

Wait, but the user's previous team used [30,44,49], which are Normal Electric, Rock Steel, and Normal Grass. Maybe now they want to avoid duplicates unless necessary.

So perhaps choosing Ground, Electric/Fighting, and Rock/Steel.

But I need to pick three indices, so maybe 35 (Ground), 17 (Electric/Fight), and 44 (Rock/Steel).

Alternatively, considering all types for coverage:

- Ground (good against Water, Grass)
- Electric (can handle Flying, etc.)
- Rock (covers Rock-type attacks)

So, perhaps selecting:

---35,17,44---

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe including a Fairy or Ghost type for added utility.

Wait, considering their previous loss, they might want to strengthen in certain areas. Maybe adding more coverage or better defensive moves.

Looking at PkmTemplate 35: Ground, high HP, good moves.
PkmTemplate 30: Electric Normal, strong stats.
PkmTemplate 44: Rock Steel, solid all-rounder.

So I think choosing these three would be a good team for the next battle.

Okay, I need to figure out which three Pokémon from the roster will give me the best chance of winning the next battle. The previous team that won had indices [35, 17, 44]. So, I should consider replacing some or all of them with better options.

Looking at each Pokémon's type and stats:

- PkmTemplate 35: GROUND type with Max_HP 160. It has moves likePsychic, which is good against Dark and Ghost types.
- PkmTemplate 17: ELECTRIC/FIGHT with Max_HP 129. Its move set includes Flying, which is versatile but might not cover all types.
- PkmTemplate 44: ROCK/STEEL with Max_HP 152. It has Rock which is strong against Psychic and Ice, and Steel which resists Rock.

I need to find three Pokémon that can cover multiple types effectively and have high HP and accuracy. Let me go through the roster:

Looking for strong types that are not covered or under-covered by the previous team. The previous team had Ground, Electric/Fight, and Rock/Steel.

Maybe I can look for a Ghost type for better coverage against Dark and Psychic, which the current team might struggle with. Also, checking for high HP, good accuracy, and moves that cover multiple types.

Looking at PkmTemplate 44: It's already on the team, but maybe replacing it with another strong type could be better.

Wait, no, the user wants to choose a new team from the roster, not necessarily replace each. So I can pick any three, regardless of previous choices, as long as they're allowed.

I should focus on types that are strong against common Pokémon types or have broad coverage.

Let me list some strong types:

- Ghost: Good vs Dark, Psychic
- Rock: Good vs Water, Ice, Electric
- Steel: Resists Rock and Ice
- Electric: Good vs Water, Ground, Air (Flying)
- Fire: Good vs Grass, Water, Ice
- Dragon: Good vs Ice, Water
- Bug: Good vs Grass, Fire, Water
- Dark: Good vs Light types (Normal, etc.)

I need to pick three that together cover as many type weaknesses as possible.

Looking for high HP and strong moves:

PkmTemplate 30: Type Electric/Normal. Max HP 156. It has Ghost move which is good against Dark and Psychic. Also, Electric can handle Water, Ground, Air. Normal covers a broad type.

PkmTemplate 49: Type Normal/Grass. Max HP 155. Normal is good for fighting multiple types. Grass is good against Water and Fire. It also has moves like Water, which can be useful against Ground and Rock.

Wait, but the previous team had Ground (index35) so maybe adding a Ghost type would help against Dark and Psychic.

Looking at PkmTemplate 13: Ghost type with Max HP 120. It has moves like Poison and Self Boosts. It could be strong against Dark and Psychic types.

So putting together:

- PkmTemplate30: Electric/Normal for coverage against Water, Ground, Air, and Dark/Psychic via Ghost.
- PkmTemplate49: Normal/Grass for Normal, Grass, and Water coverage.
- PkmTemplate13: Ghost for Dark and Psychic resistance.

That seems like a balanced team covering multiple types with high HP and good moves. So their indices are 30, 49, 13.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The user provided a lot of data about various Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves. They also mentioned that their last team won, which gives some context about what worked before.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The task is to select three Pokémon from the roster (which is a list of templates) such that these three will maximize the chances of winning the next battle. The previous team used indices [30, 49, 13], and the last result was a win with an Elo of 1351.60.

Looking at the Roster details, each Pokémon has specific attributes like type, max HP, moves, etc. The goal is to pick three that are strong together, maybe covering different types or having powerful moves that can contribute effectively in battles.

I should consider factors like the type effectiveness against others, the power of their moves (especially physical and special attacks), accuracy, healing options, and defensive capabilities. Also, previous team compositions might give clues about what worked before. The last successful team had indices 30, 49, 13, so I can look into those to see if there's a pattern or strengths that should be continued.

For example, Pokémon 30 is Electric/Normal with moves like Ghost, Light Screen, Dragon, etc. It has high accuracy and some strong physical attacks. Pokémon 49 is Normal/Grass with Water, Ghost, Target Boosts, etc., which might provide versatility in types and boosts. Pokémon 13 is Ghost with Poison and Self Boosts, which can be useful for supporting or dealing damage effectively.

When choosing a new team, I should aim to balance types to cover multiple weaknesses. Maybe include a Ghost type for support or defense, a strong Electric type for physical attacks, and another versatile Normal/Grass that can adapt. Alternatively, considering the previous indices, maybe sticking with similar strengths but different Pokémon could be beneficial.

Looking through the roster again, I should identify which Pokémon have high max HP, strong moves, good accuracy, healing options, or defensive boosts. For instance, higher max HP can improve survivability, while powerful physical and special attacks can increase damage output.

I also need to ensure that the team isn't redundant in types. Having a mix of Normal, Electric, Grass, etc., can make the team more versatile against different opponents. Maybe avoid having too many of the same type unless there's a specific reason.

Another consideration is the moves each Pokémon has. Moves with high power, accuracy, and multiple uses (like self-switch or light screen) can be very useful in battle. For example, moves that provide status effects, boost allies' stats, or protect against status can significantly impact the outcome.

I should also think about synergy between team members. If one Pokémon can heal or boost others, pairing it with another strong attacker can create a powerful combination. Similarly, having a mix of attackers and support types can maximize the team's effectiveness.

Given that the last team was successful, maybe continuing with similar roles makes sense. For example, if the previous team had a Ghost type for defense or boosts, choosing another Ghost Pokémon could provide similar benefits. Alternatively, rotating to include different types might be better depending on what the next opponent has.

I'll need to evaluate each Pokémon's strengths and how they can complement each other. It's also important to avoid picking Pokémon that are weak against common opponents or have poor defensive stats without support.

After considering all these factors, I should rank the Pokémon based on their utility, damage potential, and compatibility with others. Then, select the top three that form the most balanced and powerful team.

Okay, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on the given Roster and previous battle info. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, the user mentioned it's their first battle, so there's no prior result or Elo data. That means I can't base decisions on past wins or losses. My goal is to pick three Pokémon from the Roster that will give them the best chance in their next battle.

Looking at the Roster, each Pokémon has a Type, Max_HP, and a list of Moves with various stats like Power, Accuracy, PP, etc. I need to consider factors like Type coverage, Move effectiveness, and overall team balance.

Since it's the first battle, I should probably go for strong, versatile Pokémon that can handle different scenarios. Maybe types that are generally good in battles or have multiple effective moves against others.

Let me go through each Pokémon and see their strengths:

- PkmTemplate 0: Bug/Grass/Rock. It has Steel, Rock, Grass moves which cover a lot of ground. High PP and decent Accuracy.
- PkmTemplate 1: Fire. Ground, Steel, Fighting moves with good Power but lower Accuracy.
- PkmTemplate 2: Ghost/Electric. Good moves like Ground, Electric, Protect, Reflect, which can set up barriers and support.
- PkmTemplate 3: Poison. Has some strong physical moves and a nice Type coverage.
- PkmTemplate 4: Dark. Self Switch is a good move for team composition.
- PkmTemplate 5: Psychic/Ground. Ground is reliable, and some solid moves.
- PkmTemplate 6: Water/Psychic. Nice combo of Water and Psychic with high Max HP.
- PkmTemplate 7: Psychic/Flying. Good for special attacks and coverage.
- PkmTemplate 8: Fight/Psychic. High Power moves but maybe a bit too physical?
- PkmTemplate 9: Water. Strong moves, especially in Water battles.
- PkmTemplate 10: Electric/Dragon. Dragon moves can be strong.
- PkmTemplate 11: Dragon/Fight. Interesting mix with some powerful Normal and Dragon attacks.
- PkmTemplate 12: Bug/Fight. Good physical attackers with multiple types.
- PkmTemplate 13: Fight/Bug. Similar to 12 but maybe a different balance.
- PkmTemplate 14: Rock/ Poison. Strong physical moves, especially against Bug and Grass.
- PkmTemplate 15: Psych/Electric. Good for support and setup with high Power.
- PkmTemplate 16: Dragon/Electric. Could be good for Dragon moves and Electric support.
- PkmTemplate 17: Fire. Similar to 1 but different moves.
- PkmTemplate 18: Steel. Tanky with strong Steel moves, good for defense.
- PkmTemplate 19: Ground. Reliable with Rock and other physical moves.
- PkmTemplate 20: Electric. Good for Electric and Dragon coverage.
- PkmTemplate 21: Water. Another strong Water type.
- PkmTemplate 22: Fire/Rock. High Max HP, good combo of Fire and Rock.
- PkmTemplate 23: Electric. Similar to others but with different moves.
- PkmTemplate 24: Ice. Could be useful for cold battles.
- PkmTemplate 25: Grass. Good for Grass coverage.
- PkmTemplate 26: Elect/Bug. Strong against Ground and Water.
- PkmTemplate 27: Grass. Similar to 25 but more PP?
- PkmTemplate 28: Fairy. Nice for support with healing moves.
- PkmTemplate 29: Fire/Dark. Good for Dark coverage, which is good against Fighting.
- PkmTemplate 30: Fire. Strong Fire type with high Max HP.
- PkmTemplate 31: Fairy. Similar to 28 but maybe more Power.
- PkmTemplate 32: Poison/Fight. Strong physical moves and support.
- PkmTemplate 33: Fight. Solid all-rounder.
- PkmTemplate 34: Rock. Tanky with good Rock moves.
- PkmTemplate 35: Ground. Similar to others but with more PP.
- PkmTemplate 36: Flying. Good for sky battles, maybe not the best overall.
- PkmTemplate 37: Psych. High Power and support moves.
- PkmTemplate 38: Ghost/Fight. Can handle multiple types.
- PkmTemplate 39: Ghost. Strong with high Max HP.
- PkmTemplate 40: Fire. Similar to others but different moves.
- PkmTemplate 41: Rock. Tanky with good defense moves.
- PkmTemplate 42: Grass/Fire. Good combo of two solid types.
- PkmTemplate 43: Bug/ICE. Strong against Ground and Water.
- PkmTemplate 44: Ghost. Similar to others but maybe less PP.
- PkmTemplate 45: Dragon. Strong for Dragon moves.
- PkmTemplate 46: Poison. Strong physical attacks with good support.
- PkmTemplate 47: Rock/Ground. Tanky with good coverage.
- PkmTemplate 48: Grass/Electric. Good for multiple types.
- PkmTemplate 49: Electric/POison. Nice mix, strong moves.

Now, considering the first battle, I want a team that's versatile and can handle different opponents. Maybe pick Pokémon that have multiple effective moves against various types.

Looking at PkmTemplate 14 (Rock/Poison), it has Bug, Rock, Grass, etc., which covers a lot of ground. PkmTemplate 30 (Fire) is strong with Ground, Steel, etc., which are solid. PkmTemplate 49 (Electric/POison) adds Electric and Poison moves, which can be useful against Psychic and Water types.

Alternatively, maybe go for high HP to survive longer. PkmTemplate 39 has Ghost, which is good against Fighting and Dark, but might not cover as much. Or PkmTemplate 37 with Psych and Electric could be strong.

Wait, the user said it's their first battle, so maybe a balanced team is better. Let me think about types that can counter each other or have broad coverage. Rock/Poison (14) is good for physical attacks, Fire (30) adds a strong offensive type, and Electric/Poison (49) adds more support with Electric moves and Poison which can deal with Psychic and Water.

Alternatively, maybe go all Fire to cover multiple types, but that might be too focused. Or mix Fire, Rock, and Grass for full coverage.

But considering the last result was a first battle, so no prior Elo. Maybe focus on strong individual Pokémon.

Wait, looking at HP: 14 has Max_HP=130, 30 has 160, 49 has 82. So high HP could help in battles where they have to fight multiple opponents or take damage.

Another approach is to pick the top three based on some metric like overall effectiveness against common foes. But without knowing the opponent's team, it's tricky.

Alternatively, since it's the first battle, maybe choosing strong single types that can cover multiple threats.

Wait, but the previous result was no prior result. So I have to choose a team that can potentially win in any matchup.

Maybe focus on high PP moves for sustainability. PkmTemplate 14 has multiple moves with Max PP 10 or more.

Alternatively, considering all, maybe pick the three highest HP: 39 (143), 35 (160), and 30 (160). But wait, they have to be from the Roster provided.

Looking at the indices:

- 39: Ghost, 143
- 35: Ground, 160
- 30: Fire, 160

These are three with high HP. But maybe that's too focused on defense without considering move effectiveness.

Alternatively, perhaps select a mix of strong types and high HP.

Wait, since it's the first battle, maybe picking strong, versatile Pokémon is better to handle any possible opponents.

Looking at PkmTemplate 30: Fire, which is strong against Grass and Water. PkmTemplate 14: Rock/Poison can take down Ground, Rock, Poison, etc. PkmTemplate 49: Electric/POison has Electric moves (useful against Psychic) and Poison to handle Dark and others.

Alternatively, maybe include a Ghost type forPsychic resistance. PkmTemplate39 is Ghost with high HP.

Alternatively, perhaps go with the three highest rated templates, but I don't have ratings.

Wait, without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to optimize, so the best approach is to choose Pokémon that can cover multiple types and have strong moves.

Given that, maybe PkmTemplate30 (Fire) because Fire is a strong type against Grass and Water. PkmTemplate14 (Rock/Poison) for versatility against many types. And perhaps PkmTemplate37 (Psych) for dealing with Psychic types and other resistances.

Alternatively, to maximize the chances, maybe pick the three highest HP Pokémon: 35,30,39. But I'm not sure if that's optimal in terms of type coverage.

Wait, but considering the previous battle had no prior result, perhaps a balanced team is better.

Another approach: look for Pokémon with strong moves that can take down multiple types. For example, Ground is strong against Rock and Electric, Fire is good against Grass and Water, Rock/Poison covers a lot.

After considering all, I think choosing 30 (Fire), 14 (Rock/Poison), and 49 (Electric/POison) would provide good type coverage and high HP. Alternatively, maybe including a Ghost for better defense, but I think the highest rated might be 35,30,39.

Wait, perhaps it's better to have a team that can handle multiple types. Let me look at the moves:

- Fire (30): Can handle Grass and Water.
- Rock/Poison (14): Takes care of Ground and Poison.
- Electric/POison (49): Deals with Psychic and Dark, and has electric moves.

This seems to cover a broad spectrum of types.

Alternatively, another combination could be 35 (Ground), 30 (Fire), 39 (Ghost). But I'm not sure if that's better.

I think the best is to choose 14, 30, and 49 as they provide Fire, Rock/Poison, and Electric/POison, covering a lot of types and having decent HP.

Okay, so I need to help someone build a new Pokémon team after their last team lost. The goal is to maximize their chances in the next battle. Let's break down what I know.

First, I see that the previous team used indices [14, 30, 49]. So those were the three Pokémon they used last time. Now, since their last team lost, I should consider which Pokémon performed well or could be better.

Looking at the Roster, each PkmTemplate has Type, Max_HP, and Moves. The user provided a list from index 0 to 49, so I can go through them one by one.

Starting with each Pokémon's stats: HP is important for survivability, and moves determine their effectiveness in battle. Since the last team lost, maybe some of those Pokémon weren't effective or didn't perform well. Or perhaps new options have better moves that could give an edge.

I should evaluate each Pokémon not used before but also see if any from the previous team could be replaced for better performance.

Wait, no, the user's instruction says to choose a new 3-Pokémon team, not necessarily excluding the previous ones. So it's open; they can pick any three from the roster.

But perhaps the last result affects the choice. Since their Elo dropped after losing, maybe they need stronger Pokémon this time.

Looking at each index:

14: Type=ROCK/POISON, HP=130. Moves include BUG, PHYSICAL, etc.
30: Type=FIRE, HP=160. Moves include BUG, ICE, etc.
49: Type=ELECTRIC/POISON, HP=82. Moves include GROUND, RAIN, etc.

So the previous team had Rock/Poison, Fire, and Electric/Poison.

Now, to build a new team, perhaps they need coverage for different types or stronger moves.

Looking through the roster, I see many options. For example:

- Index 26: Type=ELECTRIC/BUG, HP=160. Moves include GROUND, RAIN, etc.
- Index 35: Type=GROUND, HP=160. Moves include ROCK, ELECTRIC_TERRAIN.
- Index 36: Type=FLYING, HP=75. Moves include GRASS, ICE, etc.

I should consider each Pokémon's type coverage and how they can support each other, maybe through type advantages or synergy.

Also, considering the last loss, perhaps adding a strong attacker or a tank could help.

Another consideration is the moves' effectiveness. For example, having multiple types that can resist or counter common types in the opposing team.

I might need to look for Pokémon with high HP and strong moves that can contribute to both offense and defense.

Wait, but without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to tailor specifically. So the best approach is to choose the three strongest available Pokémon overall, considering their type diversity and move sets.

Looking again:

Index 26 (Elec/bug) seems strong with high HP and good moves.
Index 35 (Ground) has useful terrain moves and decent stats.
Index 36 (Flying) can cover grass and ice, which are common defensive types.

Alternatively, maybe indices like 27 (Grass), 38 (Ghost/Fight), or others could be better. But I need to pick three that together have good coverage and high HP.

Wait, another approach is to look for the highest Max_HP Pokémon. Indexes with higher HP might survive longer. For example:

Index 26: 160 HP
Index 35: 160 HP
Index 27: 108 HP

So maybe picking the top three HP-wise would be beneficial.

But also, their moves matter. So even if a Pokémon has high HP, if its moves aren't effective, it might not contribute much.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing Pokémon that can deal with common resistances or have wide coverage.

I'm starting to get a bit stuck. Let me list out the top HP Pokémon:

Looking through all 50, the highest are:

26: 160
35: 160
27: 108

Wait, perhaps I should rank them by Max_HP:

1. 26, 35, 0 (140), etc.

But maybe including index 0 could be good since it's Bug/Grass with high HP and moves that cover multiple types.

Alternatively, considering the previous team had Rock/Poison, Fire, Electric/Poison. Maybe adding a Dark or Water type would provide better coverage against common opponents.

Wait, but without knowing the opponent, I can't tailor it exactly. So I have to choose three that are generally strong.

Another thought: perhaps include index 14 (Rock/Poison) again because their moves are versatile. Then pick two others that complement them.

But maybe trying a different approach: look for each Pokémon's type effectiveness against others and see how they can support each other.

Alternatively, since the last result was a loss, maybe the team needs more synergy or better defensive moves.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. The user wants three indices, so I'll go with the top three HP that seem strong in their move sets.

Looking again:

26: Electric/Bug, 160 HP, good moves.
35: Ground, 160 HP, solid moves.
0: Bug/Grass, 100 HP, but maybe not as strong as others.

Alternatively, perhaps 26 (Elec/Bug), 35 (Ground), and 27 (Grass) could be a good mix. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach is to look for the highest Max PP or accuracy, but that might not be necessary.

I think in this case, given the time constraints, the best way is to pick the three with the highest HP and strong move sets.

So possibly 26 (Elec/Bug), 35 (Ground), and 0 (Bug/Grass). But I need to check their types for coverage.

Alternatively, maybe 26, 35, and another. Wait, perhaps 26, 35, and 1 (Fire) could be good because Fire is a strong type.

But since the previous team already had Fire at index 30, maybe adding another Fire isn't necessary unless it's better.

This is tricky. I think I need to make an educated guess based on HP and move sets.

So I'll go with indices 26 (Elec/Bug), 35 (Ground), and 0 (Bug/Grass). But wait, the previous team had 14,30,49 which are Rock/Poison, Fire, Electric/Poison. Maybe a different combination is better now.

Alternatively, perhaps 26, 35, and 1 could be a good mix of Elec/Bug, Ground, and Fire.

Wait, but the user's last result was a loss, so maybe adding more defensive moves or types that are currently strong.

But without specific info on what the opponent is, it's hard to know. So I'll proceed with picking three that have high HP and versatile move sets.

After considering, I think 26 (Elec/Bug), 35 (Ground), and 0 (Bug/Grass) could be a solid team.

Okay, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The user has a simplified version of Pokémon where they build teams from a roster of templates. Each template has Type, Max_HP, and Moves. The task is to select three indices from this roster that will maximize their chances in the next battle.

Before each call, they receive:
- Roster: which is all the available Pokémon templates.
- Previous Team: the last team's indices.
- Last Result: a summary of the previous battle's outcome.

In this case, the last result says the user's last team won with an Elo of 1198.71. The previous team used indices [26, 35, 0]. So I need to analyze what those Pokémon are and then figure out which new ones would be better for the next match.

First, let me look up the details for each index from the roster:

Index 26: Type is ELECTRIC/BUG, Max_HP=160. Moves include GROUND, POWER 128, ACCURACY 0.99, PP 8 PHYSICAL, etc.
Index 35: Type is GROUND, Max_HP=160. Moves are ROCK, Power 108, PP 12 PHYSICAL, etc.
Index 0: Type is BUG, Max_HP=100. Moves like STEEL, POWER 140, ACCURACY 0.93, etc.

So the previous team had a Bug, Ground, and Electric/Bug type Pokémon. They won their last battle, so perhaps their strategy was effective. But now they need to choose new ones to maybe optimize for the next opponent or improve upon what worked before.

I should look at the current roster and see which Pokémon could complement each other in terms of types and moves. The goal is to have a balanced team that can cover multiple types and have strong moves against each other.

Looking through the roster, I need to find three Pokémon that are effective against common types or have versatile moves that can handle different opponents.

I should also consider the last result where they won, which might mean their team was strong in certain areas. Maybe the new team should focus on similar strengths but also bring in some new elements for versatility.

Let me go through each index and think about what makes them good:

- Index 26: ELECTRIC/BUG. That's a dual type that can cover both Electric and Bug moves, which are useful against Ground and Rock types.
- Index 35: GROUND. Solid choice for physical attacks and coverage against many types.
- Index 0: BUG. Good at dealing with Steel and Grass types.

Now, looking at the rest of the roster:

Index 30 is FIRE type with Max_HP=160. Moves include BUG, POWER 89, etc. Fire can be strong against Grass and Water, which are common Pokémon types.

So maybe pairing a Fire type with Ground and Electric/Bug could provide good coverage. Let's see:

- Fire (30): Covers Grass and Water.
- Ground (35): Covers Rock, Ground, and some others.
- Electric/Bug (26 or 0): Covers Electric attacks and Bug moves.

Wait, but the previous team used 0 which is Bug, so maybe using a different type could be better. Alternatively, using another Electric might add more versatility.

Looking at other indices:

Index 49: ELECTRIC/POISON. That's dual type with good moves. It can handle both Electric and Poison types, which can be useful against Grass, Water, and others.

So perhaps choosing Electric/Poison (49), Ground (35), and another strong Fire or Grass type?

Wait, but the user needs to choose three. So maybe:

- 30: Fire
- 35: Ground
- 49: Electric/Poison

This combination covers Fire, Ground, and Electric/Poison types. Fire can handle Grass and Water; Ground is good against Rock and many others; Electric/Poison can take care of Grass, Water, and Poison types.

Alternatively, maybe replacing one with another type for better coverage. Let me see:

Another option could be using a Ghost or Dark type to cover more psychological aspects, but I don't know if that's necessary unless the opponent has specific weaknesses.

But considering the last team had Bug/Ground/Electric, adding Fire and Electric/Poison seems balanced.

I should also consider Max_HP. 30 is 160 HP, which is high. 35 is also 160. 49 is 82, so a bit lower, but their moves might make them more versatile.

Another thought: If the opponent has certain types that are strong, I need to ensure this team can handle them. But without knowing the exact opponent's team, it's hard to say.

In any case, choosing three with good coverage and high HP seems like a solid strategy.

So the final decision is to pick indices 30 (Fire), 35 (Ground), and 49 (Electric/Poison).

Okay, so I'm trying to help build a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The user provided a scenario where their last team lost, and they need to choose three Pokémon from the roster to maximize their chances in the next battle.

First, I look at the instructions. They want exactly three indices, formatted as ---i1, i2, i3---, without any extra text. So my job is just to select the right indices from the provided list of 49 Pokémon templates.

The previous team that lost had indices [30, 35, 49]. I need to figure out why those were chosen and see what strengths they have, then find better alternatives if possible.

Looking at each Pokémon by their index:

- **30**: Type FIRE, Max_HP 160. Moves include BUG, Power 89, Max PP 11, PHYSICAL, Priority 1, Probability 0.36, Change Type, ICE, etc.
- **35**: Type GROUND, Max_HP 160. Moves include ROCK, Power 108, Max PP 12, PHYSICAL, Probability 0.23, ELECTRIC_TERRAIN, NORMAL, Power 95, Accuracy 0.89, etc.
- **49**: Type ELECTRIC/POISON, Max_HP 82. Moves include GROUND, Power 128, Accuracy 0.99, Max PP 8, PHYSICAL, Probability 0.09, RAIN, STEEL, Power 111, etc.

So the previous team had FIRE, GROUND, and a dual-type ELECTRIC/POISON Pokémon. The types covered are FIRE, GROUND, and POISON/ELECTRIC, which might have been used to cover various types in battle.

Now, I need to choose three new Pokémon that can either improve upon the previous choices or provide better coverage. Let's look at other high Max_HP templates that could be strong.

Looking through the list, higher Max_HP values are generally better because they mean more health points and thus more survivability. So focusing on those with Max_HP around 160 seems wise.

Let's consider each possible trio:

1. **30 (FIRE)**: Good fire-type, decent moves.
2. **35 (GROUND)**: Strong ground-type with good rock moves and high PP.
3. **49 (ELECTRIC/POISON)**: High damage electric and poison moves, but low Max_HP of 82 might be a downside.

To improve, maybe replace 49 with someone more tanky or with better coverage.

Looking for similar types:

- **26**: Type ELECTRIC/BUG, Max_HP 160. Moves include GROUND, Power 128, which is strong against ground. This could provide both bug and electric type coverage and high HP.
- **32**: Type POISON/FIGHT, Max_HP 128. Poison moves, which can be good against poison types, but fight might not complement the previous team much unless there's a need for fighting moves.

Alternatively, maybe adding another strong type.

Wait, the previous team had FIRE, GROUND, and POISON/ELECTRIC. So they covered fire, ground, and poison. Maybe we want to add something that covers a different weakness or has better offensive stats.

Looking at **30 (FIRE)** and **35 (GROUND)** are solid choices because they have high Max_HP and strong moves. Now, for the third Pokémon, maybe someone with dual types that can cover multiple weaknesses or boost effectiveness.

For example:

- **26**: ELECTRIC/BUG could be good because electric is useful against water and ground, and bug is good against grass and psychic. This might provide better coverage than poison.
- **32**: POISON/FIGHT might not add much unless there's a need for fighting moves.
- **16**: DRAGON/ELECTRIC, Max_HP 75. Not as strong as others but has electric which is useful.

Alternatively, perhaps **36 (FLYING)** could be useful with grass and ice coverage, but flying alone doesn't cover as many types effectively.

Another option is **45 (DRAGON)**, which might have good neutral moves but not sure about the types.

Wait, maybe look for a Pokémon that can cover multiple types and has high Max_HP. For example:

- **30**: FIRE
- **35**: GROUND
- **49**: ELECTRIC/POISON

Alternatively, replacing 49 with someone like **26 (ELECTRIC/BUG)** could be better because they have higher Max_HP and better moves.

So perhaps the team would be:

- **30 (FIRE)**
- **35 (GROUND)**
- **26 (ELECTRIC/BUG)**

This way, we have FIRE, GROUND, and ELECTRIC/BUG. The bug type can handle grass and psychic, which might provide better coverage than poison.

Another consideration is the previous team's loss, so maybe adding a Pokémon with high accuracy or strong moves to ensure they don't miss.

Looking at **26**, it has Power 128 against ground, which is very strong. Also, electric is good for water and ground, and bug covers grass and psychic.

Alternatively, if we want poison, perhaps **32 (POISON/FIGHT)** could be a better choice than 49 because of higher Max_HP and similar coverage.

So another possible team:

- **30 (FIRE)**
- **35 (GROUND)**
- **32 (POISON/FIGHT)**

This would give FIRE, GROUND, and POISON. The fight type can help with normal types, which might be a common opponent.

Comparing the two options: 26 vs 32.

Looking at their moves:

**26**: Moves include Ground, Electric, Bug.
- Ground: good against rock, ground, etc.
- Electric: good against water and ground.
- Bug: good against grass and psychic.

So in terms of coverage, it's versatile.

**32**: Poison/Fight. Poison is good against grass, fairy, and others. Fight can deal with normal types.

Depending on the opponent's team, one might be better than the other.

But since we don't know the opponent's types, it's safer to go for what covers more bases.

Another angle: higher Max_HP. 26 has 160, same as 30 and 35. 32 has 128, which is lower.

So maybe 26 is a better choice because of both type coverage and higher HP.

So final team would be 30, 35, 26.

Wait, but the previous team was [30, 35, 49]. So in this case, we need to choose three new indices. If I pick 26 instead of 49, that's fine because it's a different Pokémon.

Alternatively, maybe include some other type like grass or water.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to say.

Perhaps the optimal choice is to have a balance of types: FIRE, GROUND, and something that can cover multiple types.

Given all this, I think 30 (FIRE), 35 (GROUND), and 26 (ELECTRIC/BUG) would be a strong team.

Okay, so I need to figure out a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the user provided a Roster of 50 Pokémon templates, each with Type, Max_HP, and Moves. The previous team used indices [30, 35, 26], which were effective because they won the last battle, giving an Elo score of 1197.18. Now, I need to choose three new Pokémon from this roster to maximize chances in the next battle.

The instructions say to return exactly three indices as a comma-separated string within --- markers. So, no extra text, just the indices. Also, I can't include any explanation or Markdown—just plain text.

Since it's a simplified Pokémon version, I'm assuming each Pokémon has specific strengths and weaknesses based on their types. The goal is to pick a team that can effectively counter whatever the opponent throws at them. But without knowing the exact opponent type or moves, I have to make some educated guesses based on common strategies.

Looking at the previous team: indices 30, 35, 26. Let's check what those are:
- 30: Type FIRE, Max_HP 160, Moves include BUG, Power 89, etc.
- 35: Type GROUND, Max_HP 160, Moves include ROCK and others.
- 26: Type ELECTRIC/BUG, Max_HP 160, Moves include GROUND, RAIN, etc.

So their types are FIRE, GROUND, and ELECTRIC/BUG. That's a good mix of offensive and defensive types. Now, to choose new ones, I should aim for complementary types that cover multiple weaknesses.

Looking through the roster again, I need to pick three that can work together well. Let me consider popular types like WATER, GRASS, POISON, or others known for effectiveness in battle.

I notice:
- Index 0: BUG
- Index 1: FIRE
- Index 2: GHOST/ELECTRIC
- Index 3: POISON
- Index 4: DARK
- Index 5: PSYCHIC/GROUND
- Index 6: WATER/PSYCHIC
- Index 7: PSYCHIC/FLYING
- Index 8: FIGHT/PSYCHIC
- Index 9: WATER
- Index 10: ELECTRIC/DRAGON
- Index 11: DRAGON/FIGHT
- Index 12: BUG/FIGHT
- Index 13: FIGHT/BUG
- Index 14: ROCK/POISON
- Index 15: PSYCHIC/ELECTRIC
- Index 16: DRAGON/ELECTRIC
- Index 17: FIRE
- Index 18: STEEL
- Index 19: GROUND
- Index 20: ELECTRIC
- Index 21: WATER
- Index 22: FIRE/ROCK
- Index 23: ELECTRIC
- Index 24: ICE
- Index 25: GRASS
- Index 26: ELECTRIC/BUG (already used)
- Index 27: GRASS
- Index 28: FAIRY
- Index 29: FIRE/DARK (already used? No, index 30 is FIRE, but 29 is FIRE/DARK. Need to check if already in the previous team.)
Wait, the previous team was [30,35,26]. So 30 is FIRE, 35 is GROUND, 26 is ELECTRIC/BUG.

So for new choices, maybe pick types that complement these. For example, adding a WATER type could be good against Fire and Ground. Also, considering Poison could be effective against many types, and Grass can handle Electric or Bug issues.

Looking at index 9: WATER. It's a strong type that can counter both Fire and Ground, which are in the previous team. Plus, Water has moves like Tailwind and others that can boost its own team.

Next, perhaps index 3: POISON. Poison is effective against many types, especially Grass and Water, but also Electric and Rock. It's a versatile type.

Then, maybe index 25: GRASS. Grass can handle Electric and Bug, which are covered by the previous team (26 is Electric/BUG). Also, Grass can counter Fire with its moves like Solar Beam, but since we have a new FIRE in this round? Wait, no, the previous team has FIRE at 30, so adding another Fire might not be necessary unless for coverage.

Wait, but let's see. The user needs to choose three indices that are currently available, not necessarily excluding the previous ones unless they were used before. But I think each time you can use any of the 50 as long as it's in the roster. So maybe include a Grass type, as it can provide good coverage against Electric and Bug.

Alternatively, index 27 is GRASS. It has moves like Reflect and others that could be useful.

But let me also consider other options. For example, index 12: BUG/FIGHT. Bug is good against Grass and Psychic, but since the previous team has Ground (35), which is weak to Rock or Electric, maybe a Fighter can help in close combat.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's structure this:

1. The previous team was FIRE (30), GROUND (35), ELECTRIC/BUG (26). So their types cover Fire, Ground, and Electric/Bug.

2. To counter the next opponent, we need a team that can handle a variety of types. Maybe include a Water type for Fire and Electric; a Grass type for Electric and Bug; and a Poison type to deal with multiple weaknesses.

So:

- Pick index 9: WATER (type) - effective against Fire and Ground.
- Pick index 3: POISON - versatile, good against many types.
- Pick index 25: GRASS - handles Electric/Bug and provides Solar Beam for Fire.

Alternatively, if I think about the current team's weaknesses. The previous team has Fire, Ground, and Electric/BUG. So their weaknesses would be:

- Fire: Weak to Water, Grass, Rock (though Rock isn't in the team).
- Ground: Weak to Electric, Rock, etc.
- Electric/Bug: Weak to Ground, Water, Ice, etc.

So a new team could include types that counter these:

- Water: counters Fire and Electric
- Rock: counters Fire and Electric? Or maybe not necessary since we can use Grass for Fire and Electric.
- Poison: counters many types, including Fire, Ground, Electric, Bug.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a Fighting type to deal with Ghosts or other Psychic types.

Wait, but the user's goal is to maximize chances. So perhaps choosing high HP, strong moves Pokémon would be better.

Looking back at the Roster, let me see:

Which templates have high Max_HP? For example, 26: Electric/BUG, HP 160; 35: Ground, HP 160; 30: Fire, HP 160.

So maybe choose higher HP to survive longer. But perhaps also considering the type coverage.

Alternatively, think about which types are strong against others:

- Water vs Fire and Electric
- Grass vs Electric and Bug
- Poison vs many

So I'll go with WATER (9), POISON (3), and GRASS (25) as new indices.

Wait, but let me check what each of these has in terms of moves.

Looking at index 9: Type is Water. Moves include Tailwind, which boosts the team's attack. Also, some Water moves are strong against Fire and Ground.

Index 3: Type Poison. Moves include Toxic Spikes, which can disrupt opponents. Also, deals damage effectively.

Index 25: Grass. Moves like Solar Beam for Fire types, which is good if we have a Fire opponent.

Alternatively, maybe instead of Grass, pick a Fighting type to deal with Psychic or Ghosts, but I don't know what the opponent's team will be. So perhaps safer to go with Grass for coverage against Electric and Bug.

So final choice: 9,3,25.

Wait, but let me check if these are within the roster:

Yes, indices 9,3,25 exist in the provided list (0-49).

But wait, I think the user might have specific types that perform better. For example, Electric/BUG is strong against Ground and Water, but maybe a different type could be better.

Alternatively, perhaps picking Dark or Rock types for better coverage.

Wait, let me try to see:

Another approach: find which Pokémon in the roster has the best stats for surviving and dealing damage, while covering multiple weaknesses of the previous team.

The previous team's types are Fire (30), Ground (35), Electric/Bug (26). So their strengths are:

- Fire: deals damage to Grass, Water
- Ground: deals damage to Rock, Electric, etc.
- Electric/Bug: Electric is strong against Water and Ground; Bug is strong against Grass and Psychic.

So the opponent's team would probably have types that counter these. For example, Water can counter Fire and Electric; Grass counters Electric and Bug; Poison counters many, including Fire and Electric.

Thus, a new team with Water (9), Grass (25), and Poison (3) seems effective.

Alternatively, if I think about the moves:

- Water: Tailwind boosts attack
- Poison: Toxic Spikes and high damage moves
- Grass: Solar Beam against Fire

But another consideration is the previous team's last Elo was 1197.18, so perhaps they're strong, but maybe a new combination can be better.

I think I've thought through this enough. I'll go with indices 9,3,25.

Alright, I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their previous performance and the current roster. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user's last battle was won with team indices [9, 3, 25]. The last result mentions an Elo increase of 1211.94. So, their team performed well before and now they need a new team to maximize chances in the next battle.

Looking at the roster, there are 49 Pokémon templates, each with Type, Max HP, and Moves. I need to select three that can complement each other effectively.

First, I should consider the types of the previous team's Pokémon. Let me check what those were:

- Index 9: Type is WATER.
- Index 3: Type is POISON.
- Index 25: Type is GRASS.

So their last team had Water, Poison, and Grass types. Maybe diversifying or adding types that counter each other could be beneficial. Also, considering the effectiveness of their moves against each other might help in a balanced team.

Next, I should look for Pokémon that have strong moves against the previous team's types. For example, Fire types can be good against Water, Grass can be countered by Poison, and so on. Alternatively, using typings that resist or are immune to the previous team's strengths could make the new team stronger.

I also need to think about the Max HP and PP of each Pokémon. Higher Max HP and longer PP are generally better for surviving battles, especially if they're going against stronger opponents.

Looking at the current roster, I'll try to find three Pokémon that together cover a range of types, have strong attacking moves, and good defensive stats.

Let me list some potential candidates:

1. Index 30: Type is FIRE. Fire can be effective against Water (from index 9), has decent Max HP, and some powerful moves like Power 140.
2. Index 14: Type is ROCK/POISON. Rock can handle Grass and Poison types, and this Pokémon also has Toxic Spikes, which are great for control.
3. Index 49: Type is ELECTRIC/POISON. Electric can help against Water and Grass, and with Toxic Spikes as well.

Wait, let me check the types:

- Fire (30) vs Water (9): Fire's moves like Power 140 can be strong against Water's type.
- Rock/Poison (14) counters both Grass and Poison effectively.
- Electric/Poison (49) has moves that can counter Water and Grass, plus Toxic Spikes.

Also, considering their Max HP:

- 30: Max HP is 160, which is quite good.
- 14: Max HP is 130, solid.
- 49: Max HP is 82, which is a bit lower but they have strong offensive moves.

The PP (Max PP) for each:

- 30: Moves have up to Max PP 12.
- 14: Some moves go up to Max PP 13.
- 49: Most are Max PP 7 or 8.

But since the last team had higher Elo, maybe they can take more risks with lower PP but strong offensive capabilities. Also, having multiple Toxic Spikes in the new team could be a good strategy to control the battlefield.

Another consideration is the presence of moves like Reflect and Protect, which can make the Pokémon more resilient against multi-hit attacks or status moves.

Looking at index 30: It has moves like Power 140 (Physical), which is very strong, and Change Type, which might help in adapting. The Max HP is high, so it's likely to survive most attacks.

Index 14: Has both Rock and Poison types, which are good for coverage, plus Toxic Spikes. This could set up the battlefield effectively.

Index 49: Electric/ Poison type with Power 140 (Special), which can be strong against Water and Grass. Also, has Toxic Spikes.

I think these three together cover a good range of types and have strong offensive moves to take down opponents while setting up Toxic Spikes for control.

To maximize your chances in the next battle, we need to select a team that complements each other's strengths and covers a wide range of type effectiveness. Based on the previous team's performance and the current roster, here is the chosen team:

---14, 30, 49---

These Pokémon were selected for their strong offensive capabilities, type coverage, and ability to adapt to various battle scenarios.

Okay, so I need to help build a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The previous team used indices 14, 30, and 49, and they won their last battle, with an Elo rating update. My task is to choose three new Pokémon from the roster that will maximize their chances of winning the next battle.

First, I should look at what each Pokémon in the previous team does. Let me check the templates for indices 14, 30, and 49.

- **PkmTemplate 14**: Type=ROCK/POISON, Max_HP=130
  - Moves include BUG, PHYSICAL, etc., with some good stats like Power 122.

- **PkmTemplate 30**: Type=FIRE, Max_HP=160
  - Moves include BUG, PHYSICAL, ICE, FAIRY, MISTY_TERRAIN.

- **PkmTemplate 49**: Type=ELECTRIC/POISON, Max_HP=82
  - Moves include GROUND, PHYSICAL, RAIN, etc., with high Accuracy and Power.

Now, I need to consider what types are represented in the previous team. They have Rock/Poison, Fire, and Electric/Poison. So their types covered are Rock, Fire, Electric, and Poison. Maybe they covered multiple types, which is good for versatility.

Looking at the current roster, I should aim to pick Pokémon that can cover common typings or complement each other effectively. Also, considering Max_HP and moves might help in terms of offense and defense.

Let me go through some potential candidates:

- **Index 0**: Bug/Other. Could be useful with STeel and Rock moves, but maybe not the best fit unless needed for type coverage.
  
- **Index 1**: Fire. Already have FIRE in the previous team, so maybe not necessary unless they can provide good moves.

- **Index 2**: Ghost/Electric. Good Electric type, which is already partially covered by index 49, but adding more Electric might be good if it brings extra benefits.

- **Index 3**: Poison. Could be useful for Poison-type coverage, which the previous team had in 14 (Rock/POISON) and 49 (Electric/POISON). So maybe not necessary unless they have strong moves that can help.

- **Index 4**: Dark. Not sure if needed yet.

- **Index 5**: Psych/Ground. Ground is already covered by 30? Wait, 30 is Fire. Ground might be a gap if the previous team didn't cover it. Let me check: 14 (Rock/POISON), 30 (Fire), 49 (Electric/POISON). So no Ground type in the previous team. Adding a Ground type could be beneficial for coverage.

- **Index 6**: Water/Psychic. Could add water, which is not covered yet, and psychic moves.

- **Index 7**: Psych/Flying. Adds flying, but maybe less critical unless needed for aerial attacks.

- **Index 8**: Fight/Psychic. Good for fighting moves, could be strong in combat.

- **Index 9**: Water. Another water type, which would add more diversity.

- **Index 10**: Electric/Dragon. Dragon is a good type with some powerful moves, but not sure about their effectiveness.

- **Index 11**: Dragon/Fight. Fight is useful for physical attacks, and dragon adds another type.

- **Index 12**: Bug/Fight. Adds both bug and fight types, which could be helpful.

- **Index 13**: Fight/bug. Similar to index 12 but different types.

- **Index 14**: Already used.

- **Index 15**: Psych/Electric. Good for psychic and electric, already partially covered by 49.

- **Index 16**: Dragon/Electric. Electric again, and dragon.

- **Index 17**: Fire/Dark. Dark is a new type not covered yet.

- **Index 18**: Steel. Steel can be useful against Rock types, which index 14 has.

- **Index 19**: Ground. Important for ground coverage if the previous team lacked it.

- **Index 20**: Electric. Another electric type, but maybe less needed as we have 49.

- **Index 21**: Water. More water, good to add.

- **Index 22**: Fire/Rock. Rock is covered by 14, fire by 30.

- **Index 23**: Electric. Similar to others.

- **Index 24**: Ice. Could be useful for counter moves.

- **Index 25**: Grass. Adds grass coverage, which the previous team doesn't have.

- **Index 26**: Electric/Bug. Bug and electric, already covered by 49 and maybe others.

- **Index 27**: Grass. Same as above.

- **Index 28**: Fairy. Not covered yet, could be useful for fairy-type moves.

- **Index 29**: Fire/Dark. Fire is covered, dark is new.

- **Index 30**: Already used.

- **Index 31**: Fairy. Similar to index 28.

- **Index 32**: Poison/Fight. Poison is covered by 14 and 49, fight is useful.

- **Index 33**: Fight. Same as above.

- **Index 34**: Rock. Covered by 14.

- **Index 35**: Ground. Important for ground coverage.

- **Index 36**: Flying. Not covered yet.

- **Index 37**: Psych. Good for psychic moves, which are already partially covered.

- **Index 38**: Ghost/Fight. Ghost is new, fight is useful.

- **Index 39**: Ghost. Similar to above.

- **Index 40**: Fire. Already have fire.

- **Index 41**: Rock. Covered by 14.

- **Index 42**: Grass/Fire. Fire covered, grass new.

- **Index 43**: Bug/Ice. Bug not needed unless specific moves required, ice could be useful.

- **Index 44**: Ghost. Similar to others.

- **Index 45**: Dragon. Good for dragon coverage.

- **Index 46**: Poison. Covered by 14 and 49.

- **Index 47**: Rock/Ground. Rock covered, ground important.

- **Index 48**: Grass/Electric. Grass new, electric covered.

- **Index 49**: Already used.

So, considering all that, the previous team had indices [14,30,49], which are Rock/POISON, Fire, Electric/POISON. So types: Rock, Fire, Electric, Poison (from both 14 and 49). Now, to build a new team without using those indices again, I need to choose three templates from the remaining.

Looking for good stats: Max HP is important because higher HP means more survivability. So look for high Max_HP values. Let's see:

- Index 0: Bug, HP 100
- Index 1: Fire, HP 104
- Index 2: Ghost/Electric, HP 137 (high)
- Index 3: Poison, HP 145 (very high)
- Index 4: Dark, HP 139
- Index 5: Psych/Ground, HP 113
- Index 6: Water/Psychic, HP 140
- Index 7: Psych/Flying, HP 113
- Index 8: Fight/Psychic, HP 127
- Index 9: Water, HP 141 (high)
- Index 10: Electric/Dragon, HP 114
- Index 11: Dragon/Fight, HP 97
- Index 12: Bug/Fight, HP 134
- Index 13: Fight/bug, HP 85
- Index 15: Psych/Electric, HP 80 (low)
- Index 16: Dragon/Electric, HP 75 (low)
- Index 17: Fire/Dark, HP 98
- Index 18: Steel, HP 128
- Index 19: Ground, HP 120
- Index 20: Electric, HP 95
- Index 21: Water, HP 128
- Index 22: Fire/Rock, HP 150 (very high)
- Index 23: Electric, HP 114
- Index 24: Ice, HP 120
- Index 25: Grass, HP 120
- Index 26: Electric/Bug, HP 160 (highest)
- Index 27: Grass, HP 108
- Index 28: Fairy, HP 120
- Index 29: Fire/Dark, HP 98
- Index 31: Fairy, HP 156 (high)
- Index 32: Poison/Fight, HP 128
- Index 33: Fight, HP 125 (high)
- Index 34: Rock, HP 91 (low)
- Index 35: Ground, HP 160 (highest)
- Index 36: Flying, HP 75 (low)
- Index 37: Psych, HP 160
- Index 38: Ghost/Fight, HP 93
- Index 39: Ghost, HP 143
- Index 40: Fire, HP 111
- Index 41: Rock, HP 41 (very low)
- Index 42: Grass/Fire, HP 117
- Index 43: Bug/Ice, HP 148
- Index 44: Ghost, HP 98
- Index 45: Dragon, HP 113
- Index 46: Poison, HP 92
- Index 47: Rock/Ground, HP 128
- Index 48: Grass/Electric, HP 81 (low)
- Index 49: Electric/POISON, HP 82 (low)

So the top Max_HPs are:

26: 160  
35: 160  
37: 160  
31: 156  
9: 141  
21: 128  
32: 128  
47: 128  
18: 128  
39: 143  
34: 91 (low)  
33: 125  
19: 120  
24: 120  
25: 120  
28: 120  
So from these, choosing three.

But also considering their types and what might be effective against the previous team's types. Previous team was Rock/POISON, Fire, Electric/POISON. So types covered were Rock, Fire, Electric, Poison.

The new team should have types that are not easily countered or that can counter the previous team's types.

Looking at the current pool:

- Type: Dark (index 4)  
- Type: Grass (multiple)  
- Type: Ice (24)  
- Type: Water (9,21)  
- Type: Steel (18)  
- Type: Ghost (39)  
- Type: Bug (0,12,26)  
- Type: Fairy (28,31)  
- Type: Electric (23, 16, etc.) but some have already been used? Wait, no, the previous team was [14(Rock/POISON),30(Fire),49(Electric/POISON)]. So their types were Rock, Fire, Electric. Poison as well.

So in new team, need to avoid using Rock or Fire unless they are strong against others, but since last battle's team had those, maybe it's better not to include them again unless necessary.

Looking for types that can counter the previous team:

- Rock is weak against Water and Grass.
- Fire is weak against Ice, Rock, Water, etc.
- Electric is weak against Ground and Rock.

So perhaps choosing types that are strong against these:

- For Rock: choose Water or Grass.
- For Fire: choose Ice, Rock, or Water.
- For Electric: choose Ground.

But maybe it's better to focus on high HP and effectiveness.

Alternatively, since the previous team was strong in certain areas, maybe pick types that are strong against them but also have high HP.

Wait, perhaps a more strategic approach is needed. Let me think about what each of the previous team members does:

Index 14: Rock/POISON  
- Type: Rock and Poison  
- Moves include things like Power 122, etc.

Index 30: Fire  
- Type: Fire  
- High HP, strong moves.

Index49: Electric/POISON  
- Type: Electric and Poison  
- Also high HP.

So the previous team had coverage in multiple types that are strong against each other. So perhaps to counter them, we can choose Pokémon that have strong typing against those or provide coverage for weaknesses.

Alternatively, maybe avoiding similar types as before would be better.

Wait, but how do I know what their moves do? Each move has type effectiveness, so if a new team can cover the previous team's weak points, it might help.

But without knowing the specifics of each move, it's hard to say. So perhaps focusing on high HP is safer.

Looking at the top 3 Max_HPs are indices:

26: Bug/Electric  
35: Ground  
37: Psychic  

Wait, index 35 is Ground type with HP 160. That's a solid choice. Ground is strong against Electric and Rock, which were used in previous team (Rock/POISON and Electric/POISON). So having Ground could counter those.

Index 26 is Bug/Electric. Since Electric was used before, but having Bug would add another type that may not be covered by the previous team's types.

Index37: Psychic. Not sure about effectiveness against others, but it's a unique type.

Alternatively, maybe choosing Fire or Rock again, but perhaps it's better to avoid them if possible.

Wait, considering that the last battle was won, so the Elo is 1227.97. So perhaps the previous team is strong, so we need a new team that can possibly counter it.

But I'm not sure about the specifics of their moves. So maybe choosing high HP and types that are strong against common types.

Looking at index 35: Ground type with high HP and useful moves (Rock, Power 108, etc.). That's a solid choice as Ground counters Electric and Rock.

Then, perhaps another type like Water or Ice to counter Fire.

Wait, index9 is Water with Max_HP=141. Or index21: Water/DRAGON.

Or maybe index34: Rock, but since previous team has Rock via index14, so including another Rock might not be as effective unless it's better.

Alternatively, index26: Bug/Electric. Electric can counter Ground (if the opponent uses Ground moves), but I'm not sure how that works in battle.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to have a team with types that are strong against the previous team's types.

The previous team had Rock/POISON, Fire, and Electric/POISON.

So:

- Rock: weak to Water and Grass.
- Fire: weak to Ice, Rock, etc.
- Electric: weak to Ground.

So, for new team, perhaps including:

- Water (to counter Rock)
- Ice (to counter Fire)
- Ground (to counter Electric)

Looking at the roster:

- Index9: Water  
- Index21: Water/DRAGON  
- Index24: Ice  
- Index35: Ground  
- Maybe also index34: Rock but that's same type as previous team.

So, choosing Ground, Water, and Ice would provide coverage against all three types of the previous team.

Looking at Max_HP:

Index9: 141  
Index21: 128  
Index24: 120  
Index35:160

So the highest is 35 (Ground) with HP160, then index9 (Water, 141), then index21 (Water/DRAGON, 128).

Alternatively, maybe including Ice and Ground.

Wait, but if I choose Ground, Water, and Ice, that's three types. But the previous team has Rock/POISON, Fire, Electric/POISON. So those are three different types as well.

So each of our new team's types can counter one of their types.

Thus:

- Ground counters Electric and Rock
- Water counters Rock
- Ice counters Fire

That seems like a good strategy.

Now, looking for the highest HP in these categories.

Ground: index35 (160HP)  
Water: index9 (141HP)  
Ice: index24 (120HP)

So team would be 35,9,24. But wait, are there other types that can cover more?

Alternatively, maybe including a type like Dragon or others, but I think Ground, Water, Ice is solid.

Wait, another thought: since the previous team's Electric/POISON (index49) has some moves that might be countered by Ground. So having Ground would help against both Rock and Electric.

Similarly, Water can counter Rock, and Ice can counter Fire.

So yes, 35 (Ground), 9 (Water), and 24 (Ice).

Wait, but the previous team had two Poisons: index14 (Rock/POISON) and index49 (Electric/POISON). So including Ground would help against both of them as well.

So I think this is a good approach.

Alright, I'm trying to help someone who's part of a Pokémon team-building machine. They need to choose a new three-Pokémon team from a given roster based on their past performance and the previous battle results.

So, let me break down what they provided:

- **Previous Team**: The last team used had indices 35, 9, and 24.
- **Last Result**: Their last team won, which means the new team should aim to continue that winning streak.
- **Roster**: A list of 49 Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves.

The goal is to select three Pokémon from this roster that can maximize their chances in the next battle. I need to consider factors like type synergy, move coverage, resistance to common types, and maybe even team composition strategies.

First, let's look at the previous team:

- **Index 35**: Type is GROUND.
- **Index 9**: Type is WATER.
- **Index 24**: Type is ICE.

So, the last team had a mix of Ground, Water, and Ice types. These are all Earth types, which can be strong together because they cover multiple types that are often useful in battles.

Now, since the last result was a win, the new team should likely build on what worked before but maybe add some new elements to counter any potential weaknesses or adapt to common strategies.

Looking through the roster, I need to find Pokémon that can complement each other. Ground is already covered by index 35, so maybe adding Fire and Electric would provide good coverage against common types like Water or Grass. Alternatively, considering the last team had Ice, perhaps a Rock type could be useful for coverage against Ice's weaknesses.

Wait, no, actually, since the previous team won, maybe sticking with similar strong types is better. Let me check each of the indices:

- **35**: Ground
  - Ground is versatile because it resists Earth-based attacks and can cover multiple types.
- **9**: Water
  - Water is good for supporting and taking advantage of moves that boost Water resistance.
- **24**: Ice
  - Ice is strong against Fire and Grass, which are common attacking types.

So, the previous team had a solid mix. Now, to choose new Pokémon, I should look for types that complement these or provide additional coverage.

Looking through the roster:

- **Index 14**: Rock/POISON.
  - Rock can help with Ground resistance and is useful against Fire and Ice types.
  - Poison adds versatility with status moves like Toxic Spikes.
- **Index 30**: Fire.
  - Fire is a strong attacker, good for dealing damage to Grass and Water types.
  - It also resists Ice attacks, which could be beneficial.

Another option is **Index 34**: Rock.
- Rock can support Ground and provide coverage against Ice moves.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Dragon type could be useful as they are versatile.

Wait, but the last team already had Ice (24), so adding another Ice might not be necessary. Maybe a Dragon would add more flexibility.

Let me check the types:

- **35**: Ground
- **9**: Water
- **24**: Ice

If I were to replace one of these with another type, say Fire or Rock, it could provide better coverage.

Looking at index 30: Fire is strong and can complement both Water and Ground. It also has moves like Flame Thrower which are powerful.

So, replacing the Ice (24) with Fire (30) might be a good idea. Now, let's see what other types to add.

If I have:

- **35**: Ground
- **9**: Water
- **30**: Fire

That covers three strong types: Ground for versatility, Water for support, and Fire for offensive power.

Alternatively, adding another type like Electric could be beneficial because it can handle Ground moves' weaknesses (like Electric Shock), but since the previous team already has Ground, maybe not necessary unless the opponent has a lot of Electric attacks.

Wait, but in the current lineup, having a Water (9) and Fire (30) with Ground (35) covers a good range. Let me check if any other types can add more synergy.

Looking at index 14: Rock/POISON could be useful because it can cover against Ice and provide Poison moves which are good against Grass and Water.

So, perhaps replacing the Water or Ground with Rock would make sense. But since Ground is already strong, maybe adding Rock alongside Fire is better.

Alternatively, let me think about each Pokémon's moves.

For example, index 30 (Fire) has moves like Flaming Thrower which can be very effective against Water and Grass types. It also has some defensive moves like Heal, but not sure if that's as critical here.

Index 35 (Ground): Moves include Earthquake, which is strong, and can handle a variety of types.

Index 9 (Water): Can have moves like Aqua Jet for offensive power, and Tailwind to boost allies' evasion.

So, the combination seems solid. Now, considering all that, I think replacing one of the existing indices with a Fire or Rock type would strengthen the team further.

In this case, since they already have Ground and Water, adding Fire (30) might complement it well.

But wait, the previous team had 35,9,24: Ground, Water, Ice. So, maybe the next team can be 35,9,30 to keep two Earth types and add Fire for offensive.

Alternatively, if I think about type coverage, having a mix of Ground, Water, and Fire covers a lot of bases.

Another consideration is the moves each Pokémon has. For example, index 35 (Ground) has moves like Rock Slide which can be strong against Ice types. Index 9 (Water) might have Hydro Pump, which can be powerful against Fire types. So, this team setup could have a good balance between offense and defense.

I think that selecting indices 35, 9, and 30 would provide a strong team with Ground for versatility, Water for support, and Fire for offensive power.

Okay, I need to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team from the given roster based on the last battle's outcome. The user provided that their previous team won with an Elo update, and they used indices [35, 9, 30]. Now, I have to select three different Pokémon from the roster to maximize their chances in the next battle.

First, let me look at what each index represents. Each index corresponds to a specific Pokémon template with Type, Max_HP, and Moves. The goal is to pick the best possible trio that can counter whatever the opponent might throw at them.

Since the last team won, I should analyze what made those Pokémon effective. Looking at indices 35, 9, and 30:

- **Index 35**: Ground-type with high HP (160) and moves that include Rock, which is strong against other types like Bug and Electric. It also has a move that heals a bit.
- **Index 9**: Fire-type with decent stats and some strong moves like Power 140 against Grass and Rock.
- **Index 30**: Another Fire-type but with more powerful moves, such as Power 89 against Bug and Ice.

So, the previous team was effective because of their types (Ground and Fire) which cover a range of weaknesses. Ground is good against Electric, Water, Ice, etc., while Fire is strong against Grass, Rock, etc.

Now, considering the new team, I should aim for complementary types that can cover multiple threats. Let's consider possible types:

1. **Ground**: For versatility against various types.
2. **Fire**: To handle Grass and Rock opponents.
3. **Electric**: Because it’s strong against Water and Ground, which are common.

Looking through the roster, I need to find indices with these types and strong moves.

- **Ground Type**: Index 35 is already used, so maybe another Ground Pokémon like index 19 or 39. But let me check their moves.
  
  - Index 19: Ground, HP 120, Rock move with Power 108. That's solid, but if I want a different one, perhaps 39 (Ground) has Protect and Water move, which is useful against Water-type opponents.

- **Fire Type**: The existing index 30 is Fire. Another strong Fire option is index 14, which is Rock/Poison. Wait, no, that's Rock/ Poison. Hmm, maybe index 1 (Fire) or index 17 (Fire). Index 1 has Max HP 104 and some good moves. Alternatively, index 40 is another Fire type.

- **Electric Type**: Looking for Electric types. Indices like 26 (Elect/ Bug), 33 (Fighting), 34 (Rock), etc. Maybe index 37: Psychic/Electric with high HP and useful moves like Power 127 against Dragon. Or index 43: Bug/Electric, but that's more Bug.

Wait, perhaps I should choose an Electric type that can handle both Water and Ground opponents effectively. Index 37 is a good choice because it has a strong move against Dragon and Electric, which could be helpful in various battles.

Putting it together:

- **Ground**: Let's go with index 35 again? Wait, no, the user might want to avoid repeating indices unless necessary. Alternatively, maybe choose a different Ground Pokémon like index 19 or 39.

But looking at the previous team, they used 35, so perhaps adding another Fire and an Electric would be better. So:

- **Fire**: Choose index 30 again? Or maybe a different one like index 1 (Fire) with Max HP 104.
  
  Index 1: Type Fire, HP 104, Moves include Ground, Power 97, etc. That seems solid.

- **Electric**: Index 37 is Electric/ Psychic with high Power and moves that can cover multiple types.

So, the team would be:

1. Index 35 (Ground)
2. Index 30 (Fire)
3. Index 37 (Electric)

Wait, but I think index 35 was already in the previous team. Maybe to avoid repetition, choose a different Ground Pokémon. For example, index 39 is Ghost/Fighting, which might not be as strong as other options.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing index 19: Ground with Rock and Electro Terrain, which could be beneficial against Electric types.

But I'm not sure if I should include another Fire or maybe a Dark type for coverage. Alternatively, using an Electric/Psychic like index 37 could provide good coverage against Dragon and other types.

After considering, perhaps the best team is:

- Ground: Index 35
- Fire: Index 30
- Electric: Index 37

This combination covers multiple types effectively, with Ground handling Water and Electric, Fire handling Grass and Rock, and Electric handling Dragon and Water. The high HP on all three should also help in long battles.

Alright, I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me break down what they've provided.

First, the last battle was won with Elo increasing to 1284.50. The previous team used indices [35, 30, 37]. Now, the task is to pick three new templates from the roster that can maximize their chances in the next battle.

Looking at the Roster, each Pokémon has a Type, Max HP, and a list of Moves with their power, accuracy, and other stats. The goal is to select the best three that complement each other and cover different types or strengths to counter any opposing team.

Since the last team won, I should consider what made them successful. But without knowing the exact opposing team, it's tricky. So I'll focus on selecting Pokémon that have high HP, strong moves, and good coverage of types.

Let me go through each index one by one:

- Index 35: Ground-type with high Max HP (160) and solid moves like Rock (Power 108) and normal moves. It can handle ground-based attacks and has decent physical stats.
- Index 30: Fire-type with a max HP of 160, good moves including Bug and Ice. This could provide both offensive and defensive strengths against various types.
- Index 37: Psychic-type with high Max HP (160). It has strong special moves and can handle status effects, which is useful in extended battles.

Now, I need to see if these types are balanced. Ground covers physical defense, Fire adds offense and coverage against grass and water, and Psychic provides special attack strength and status resistance.

I should check for type coverage: Fire, Ground, and Psychic. These are all distinct types and provide a well-rounded team. Each can support the others in different scenarios.

Looking at their movesets, each has high accuracy and power, which is good for consistency in battle. The Max HP also contributes to their durability.

I don't see any immediate weaknesses in this combination. They cover multiple types and have strong individual stats. This should give them a good chance against most opponents.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which three Pokémon from this roster will give me the best chance of winning the next battle. The user mentioned that it's their first battle, so there's no prior result to consider. That probably means I can't rely on any historical data or strategies based on past wins or losses.

First, I need to look at each Pokémon's type and their moves. Since it's the first battle, maybe I should focus on having a well-rounded team with good offensive and defensive capabilities. Maybe a mix of types that cover multiple weaknesses would be good.

Looking through the roster, there are a lot of different types like Electric, Ghost, Steel, Dragon, etc. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses. I should consider what types are effective against others and how they might complement each other.

I also notice that some Pokémon have high Max HP, which could be important in battles where survival is key. For example, PkmTemplate 0 has a Normal/Ghost type with decent HP and some strong moves. Template 6 is a Rock/Fight type with high HP and good attack moves. Template 30 is Dragon, which can be really powerful with moves like Electric and others.

I think I should pick Pokémon that have versatile move types—maybe some Special, Physical, and maybe even some Special attacks for coverage. Also, considering the availability of multi-type Pokémon could be beneficial because it allows for more adaptability in different situations.

Looking at Template 30: Dragon type with decent HP and a variety of moves including Electric, which is strong against Water and Steel types. That could be useful if the opponent has Water or Steel Pokémon.

Template 14 is Electric/Dark, which has good offensive options like Dragon Dance and Dark Pulse. It can switch types using Change Type, which might help against different opponents.

Template 49 is Water type with a focus on Grass, Ghost, and Ground moves. The Water type can be effective against Fire and Ice, so that could provide some coverage for other team members.

Putting it all together, I think having a Dragon (30) as a strong attacker, an Electric/Dark (14) for versatility and switching types, and a Water (49) for additional offensive and defensive options would make a solid team. This combination covers multiple type strengths and provides flexibility in battle.

Alright, I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their previous loss. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the user provided a lot of data about different Pokémon templates, each with Type, Max HP, and Moves. The goal is to pick three indices from this roster that will maximize the chances in the next battle. 

The user's last result was a loss, so I need to consider what factors might have led to that loss and how to mitigate them. Since the previous team used indices 30, 14, and 49, I should look at those Pokémon's types and moves to see if there are weaknesses or areas where they could improve.

Looking at index 30: It's a Dragon type with Electric and Rock moves. The Dragon type is versatile, but maybe it lacks certain resistances or boosts that would be helpful in different matchups. 

Index 14 is an Electric/Dark Pokémon with Dragon and Rock moves. Electric is good for dealing damage and can set up boosts, but maybe it's not covering all necessary types.

Index 49 is a Water type with Grass and Ghost moves. Water can be strong against Grass and Ghost, which are common in the roster, but perhaps there's a better choice that covers multiple resistances or has more powerful moves.

To improve the team, I should aim for coverage of different types, effective move sets, and synergy between Pokémon. Since the last team lost, maybe they lacked certain type advantages or had weak points.

I notice several Steel types in the roster, like indices 35 and 36, which could provide strong physical attacks and resistances. Also, Ghost and Electric types are quite common but might be too reliant on specific movesets.

Looking for a mix of offensive and defensive strengths, perhaps including a Dragon, a Steel, and another versatile type would work well. For example, index 35 is a Steel with good moves like Steel, which can handle multiple resistances and boosts. Index 36 is Ghost/Steel with nice stats and moves that could support the team.

For the third Pokémon, maybe a Fire or Electric type to add more offensive options. Alternatively, considering the previous loss, perhaps adding a Pokémon that counters the last opposing types would help. 

Wait, I should also consider the moves' accuracy and power. High accuracy and strong physical attacks can boost the team's effectiveness. Pokémon with moves like Protect are useful for reducing damage taken.

Putting it together, choosing indices 35 (Steel), 36 (Ghost/Steel), and maybe 30 (Dragon) could provide a balanced team with good resistances and offensive capabilities. Alternatively, if I think another type might perform better, but I have to stick with the given roster.

I need to make sure not to include duplicates unless it's necessary for coverage. So, final choice: 35, 36, and perhaps another that complements their types.

Okay, so I need to help this user build a new Pokémon team based on their previous loss. The last result says they lost with an Elo of around 1168, and their previous team was [35, 36, 30]. Now, they have the Roster of all available Pokémon templates, each with Type, Max_HP, and Moves.

First, I should figure out what types were on the previous team. Indices 35, 36, and 30 correspond to:

- Index 35: Type STEEL
- Index 36: Type GHOST/STEEL
- Index 30: Type DRAGON

So their last team had Steel, Ghost/Steel, and Dragon types.

Since they lost, maybe their team wasn't effective against the opposing types. The user wants to maximize their chances next time, so I need to consider what types would be strong in their current roster and complement each other.

Looking at the Roster, there are several Electric types that have high Special Attack moves and can use moves like Force Switch, which might help in battle. Also, Dark and Fairy types are popular because they can deal with various typings and have good moves like Self Switch or Trickroom.

I should look for Pokémon that can cover multiple types effectively. For example, if I pick Electric, it's a versatile type with strong moves. Dark is also strong due to its resistance against Ghost and access to moves like Disable and Dark-type boosts. Fairy can handle both Dragon and Ghost types, which were part of the previous team.

I need to avoid picking types that are weak against what the previous team had. Since they lost, maybe their last team was countered by certain types. So choosing strong counters for those might help.

Looking at index 29: Electric type with high HP and good moves like Electric Pulse. That could be a solid choice as it's versatile and can handle multiple roles.

Index 14 is Electric/Dark, which adds both Electric and Dark to the team. It also has moves like Dragon Claw, which could be useful against Dragon types.

Index 49: Water type with Fairy and Ground moves. This could help cover Water and Fairy, providing a strong physical attacker and good multi-type coverage.

Putting it all together, these three indices (29, 14, 49) seem to provide a balanced Electric, Dark, and Water/Fairy setup, which should be effective against the previous team's types and potentially strengthen their Elo.

Okay, so I need to help this user build a new Pokémon team based on their previous losses and the provided roster. Let me start by understanding what they have given.

They mentioned that their last team lost, resulting in an Elo of around 1151. They also provided the indices of their previous team: [29, 14, 49]. Each index corresponds to a specific Pokémon template with certain stats like Type, Max HP, and Moves.

My first step is to figure out what went wrong with the last team that caused the loss. Without knowing the exact battle details, I can infer that maybe the team wasn't effective against the opposing team's types or strategies. Since it's a simplified version of Pokémon, I'll focus on the types, moves, and stats provided.

Looking at the previous team:
- Index 29: Type ELECTRIC with high Max HP (160) and some strong moves like Electric attack, Reflect, and Tailwind.
- Index 14: Type ELECTRIC/DARK with decent Max HP (107) and moves like Dragon, Target Boosts, Rock, etc.
- Index 49: Type WATER with Max HP (128), Water moves, Grass and Ground immunity, and some strong physical attacks.

I notice that all three are Electric types, which might have been a problem if the opposing team had types resistant to Electric or if there was overlap in type advantages. Also, having multiple Electric types could limit their effectiveness against certain opponents.

Now, I need to choose a new team of three Pokémon that can complement each other and potentially counter whatever they might be facing next. Let's look at the roster for possible candidates.

Starting with Type coverage: perhaps having a mix of types like Electric, Water, and another strong type could provide more versatility. Maybe adding a Ghost or Dark type to deal with Psychic or Fairy opponents.

Looking through the indices:

- 0: Normal/Ghost – Could add some offensive moves and resistances.
- 2: Steel/Psychic – Good for defense and special attacks, which can be useful against certain types.
- 4: Dark/Psychic – Great for neutralizing Psychic or Ghost types with moves like Self Switch and Disable.
- 7: Fairy/Rock – Adds Fairy type which is strong against Dragon, and Rock for Ground coverage.
- 10: Bug – Good against Dragon and Fairy, but might be weak against certain types.
- 12: Electric – Another Electric to bolster the team's offensive capabilities.
- 14: Electric/Dark – Already used last time, might not be the best choice again unless necessary.
- 30: Dragon – Can be strong against Electric, but might have weaknesses.
- 31: Steel/Electric – High Max HP and good defensive moves.

I need to pick three that can cover different types and have strong offensive moves. Maybe:

1. 2 (Steel/Psychic) for defense and resistance against Psychic, Fire, Rock, etc.
2. 4 (Dark/Psychic) for dealing with Psychic, and has Self Switch to support the team.
3. 7 (Fairy/Rock) for Fairy attacks and Rock coverage against Ground types.

Alternatively, considering their previous loss, perhaps adding a strong Electric type like 29 again might be beneficial if they need more offensive power. But since they already used it before, maybe rotating with another type would be better.

Another consideration is Max HP. Higher HP can sustain more damage in battle, which could have been an issue if their last team had lower HP and lost.

Looking at the moves, Electric types have strong physical attacks with high PP, which are good for consistent damage. However, if they faced a team with Immunities or Resistances, they might not have performed well.

In the new team, including a Dark type like 4 could help against Psychic and Ghost types, which were perhaps problematic before. Also, having multiple Electric/Dark types (like 14) might provide better coverage.

Wait, but the user's last result was a loss. Maybe their previous team had too many similar types or not enough variety to handle the opponent's strategies. So adding more varied types could help.

Let me think about type matchups. If the next battle involves Psychic, Fairy, or Dragon teams, having a mix of Electric, Dark, and maybe Fairy/Rock would be good.

- Electric: Good against Dragon, Rock.
- Dark: Good against Ghost, Psychic.
- Fairy/Rock: Good against Dragon, Ground, etc.

So, selecting indices 2 (Steel/Psychic), 4 (Dark/Psychic), and 7 (Fairy/Rock) would give a balanced team with offensive and defensive capabilities across different types. Alternatively, maybe include index 29 again for another Electric type to boost their attack.

But the user might not want to repeat the same Pokémon if possible, unless it's necessary. So perhaps choosing 2, 4, and 7 is better for variety.

Wait, but I also need to check Max HP. Let's see:

- 2: 119 HP
- 4: 129 HP
- 7: 34 HP (which seems low, so maybe not the best choice)

Ah, that's a problem. Having a Pokémon with only 34 HP is risky. If they need to include three indices, maybe replace 7 with another higher HP type.

Looking again:

Perhaps choosing 2 (Steel/Psychic), 4 (Dark/Psychic), and 12 (Electric) would be better, as all have decent HP. Electric can cover Dragon and Rock, Dark can handle Psychic and Ghost, Steel is good against Fire, Ice, etc.

Alternatively, maybe 0 (Normal/Ghost), which has higher HP (102) and useful moves like Trickroom, but Normal might not be the best type unless needed.

Wait, considering that their last team had three Electric types, it's possible they need a more balanced team with different types. So perhaps including Electric, Dark, and Steel would provide good coverage.

So, maybe 2 (Steel/Psychic), 4 (Dark/Psychic), and 12 (Electric) as the new team. This mix covers multiple types and has decent HP.

Another thought: the user's previous team lost, so perhaps they need to switch up their strategy. Maybe adding a Ghost type could help with resistances against certain moves or types.

Wait, index 0 is Normal/Ghost. It might not have the highest stats but can be useful in certain situations. So, maybe including 0 as one of the indices would provide additional defensive options.

Alternatively, since they lost last time, perhaps their team composition was too weak. So they need stronger, more resilient Pokémon.

Looking at Max HP:

- 2: 119
- 4: 129
- 12: 142

These are all decent HP, so that's good. Their moves also have high PP and power, which can be beneficial in battles.

I think the best approach is to choose a mix of Electric (for Dragon/Rock), Dark (for Psychic/Ghost), and Steel (for Fire/Ice). So, indices 2,4,12.

Wait, but index 12 is Electric with 79 HP. Hmm, that's lower than some others. Maybe it's better to include higher HP types.

Alternatively, maybe 29 (160 HP), 14 (107 HP), and 49 (128 HP) would be a strong team with high HP. But I'm not sure if they performed well last time because of their type combinations.

Wait, the previous indices were [29,14,49], which are Electric (29), Electric/Dark (14), and Water (49). So maybe it's better to rotate out some lower-performing types or ones that didn't work before.

But without knowing the specifics of why they lost, it's hard to say. But based on their types, maybe adding more defensive and versatile Pokémon would help.

Considering all this, I think choosing 2 (Steel/Psychic), 4 (Dark/Psychic), and 12 (Electric) might be a good balance. Or perhaps 29, 14, and another strong type.

Wait, but the user's last team lost with Elo 1151. They need to improve their chances, so maybe adding Pokémon with higher Base Attack or better move sets could help.

Looking at the templates:

- Index 2: Steel/Psychic, moves include Bug, which might be useful against Dragon or other types.
- Index4: Dark/Psychic, which can handle Ghost and Psychic opponents.
- Index12: Electric, good for Dragon and Rock.

Alternatively, maybe including a Fairy type could help with Dragon and Ice teams. So index7 is Fairy/Rock but with low HP (34). Maybe not ideal.

So perhaps the best trio would be 2,4,12 as they have decent HP and cover multiple types.

First, the user lost their last battle with an Elo of 1131.92. Their previous team used indices [2, 4, 12]. So I should look at those templates and see what they have in terms of types, moves, and stats to figure out why they might have lost.

Looking at index 2: it's a Steel/Psychic type with Max HP 119. Its moves include Bug, Electric, etc., but more importantly, each move has certain effects like accuracy, power, and priority. Then there's index 4: Dark/Psychic with Max HP 129. It has moves like Psychic, Power 112, and some boosts. Index 12 is an Electric type with Max HP 79. Its moves include Fire, Dragon, etc.

I need to analyze why this team might have lost. Maybe their types weren't effective against the opposing team's types? Or perhaps their move sets weren't strong enough. Alternatively, maybe their synergy wasn't good.

Now, the user wants a new team that can maximize their chances of winning next time. So I should consider what types and moves are strong in this roster and how they can complement each other without overlapping weaknesses.

Looking through all the templates again, perhaps choosing types that cover multiple effective strategies would be better. For example, Electric and Psychic might provide good coverage with their respective moves. Also, considering high HP and strong moves could help in battles.

I should also think about the user's previous team composition. They had two Psychic/Dark and one Electric types. Maybe adding another type that covers a different weakness or provides a strong boost could be beneficial.

Looking at the available indices, I need to pick three that might work well together. For example, maybe 14 (Electric/Dark), which has good moves like Dragon and Target Boosts. Then, perhaps 30 (Dragon) with Electric moves, and 49 (Water). This mix could provide a range of types and strong moves.

Wait, but I need to ensure that each type is effective against others. Electric can be strong against Water and Ground, while Water can be used effectively in certain battles. Dragon moves are also powerful, so having multiple Dragon users might be good for coverage.

Alternatively, maybe selecting 14 (Electric/Dark), 30 (Dragon), and 49 (Water) gives a good mix of types that can cover each other's weaknesses. Electric can deal with Water and Ground, Dark is versatile, and Dragon provides strong moves.

I should also consider the user's previous team's Elo and their loss to see if they need more offensive or defensive capabilities. Since they lost, maybe adding more powerful attackers would help them win in the future.

So, after considering all this, I think the best new team would be 14, 30, and 49. They cover Electric/Dark, Dragon, and Water types with strong move sets, which should improve their chances next time.

Okay, so I need to help choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The user's last battle resulted in a loss, and their Elo is now 1111.32. They want a new team that can maximize their chances of winning the next battle.

First, let me look at the roster provided. There are 49 Pokémon templates with various types, Max HP, and moves. The previous team used indices [14, 30, 49], which correspond to Pokémon 14, 30, and 49.

I should consider what might have gone wrong in their last loss. Since they lost, maybe the team wasn't effective against the opposing strategies or types. So, I need to pick a new set that can counter those weaknesses.

Let me start by examining each of the previous Pokémon:

- **Pokémon 14**: Type is ELECTRIC/DARK. It has moves like Dragon, Target Boosts, Rock, Reflect, etc. It seems solid with good accuracy and power.

- **Pokémon 30**: Type is DRAGON. This is a specialized type that resists Dragon moves but can be weak against certain others. Its moves include Electric, Trickroom, Rock, Power 114, etc.

- **Pokémon 49**: Type is WATER. It has Grass, Ghost, Rain, Psychic, Power 112, and other moves.

Now, thinking about the types in the new team: maybe adding a type that complements or counters the previous ones would be good. For example, adding a Ghost or Rock type might help cover more defensive needs.

Looking at the roster, I should find Pokémon with strong stats that can synergize well. Let me consider each slot:

1. **First Slot**: Maybe a strong Electric type since it was part of the last team and can provide consistent damage.

2. **Second Slot**: Perhaps a Dragon or Rock type to take advantage of moves like Rock or Dragon, which can be good against many opponents.

3. **Third Slot**: A Water type that complements the team, maybe with good special attack and defensive moves.

Looking through the indices again, I see:

- Index 14 is ELECTRIC/DARK, which is already in the previous team, but perhaps another Electric Pokémon could provide more benefits. For example, index 29 is also Electric but has Tailwind, Reflect, etc., which might be useful.

- Index 30 is DRAGON, which was part of the last team and works well against certain types.

- Index 49 is WATER, which can be good for support or special attacks.

Alternatively, maybe replacing some of the previous Pokémon with others that have better stats. For example, index 20 is Steel/Electric with high Max HP and good moves.

I should also consider the move sets. High accuracy and powerful moves are important to ensure they can take down opponents effectively.

Another consideration is defensive moves like Reflect or Light Screen which can help in long battles by reducing damage taken.

Looking at the possible replacements:

- Index 26: FIGHT/NORMAL with Light Screen, which could provide good defense.

- Index 48: NORMAL with Dragon and Protect, which might be useful against Dragon-type opponents.

I need to ensure that the new team has a mix of types that can handle various opponent types. For example, having a Ghost or Rock type for switching into certain terrain moves.

Also, considering the previous loss, maybe the last Pokémon couldn't switch effectively or had poor defensive moves. So, adding a Pokémon with good defensive moves like Reflect could help.

After evaluating, I think replacing two of the previous indices with more supportive or powerful ones would be beneficial. For instance:

- Keeping index 14 for its Electric/Dark type and strong moves.

- Replacing index 30 with another Dragon type that has better stats or different moves.

- Replacing index 49 with a Pokémon that provides good defense, like Normal with Light Screen.

Looking at the options, indices 26 (FIGHT/NORMAL) and 48 (NORMAL) both have useful defensive moves. Maybe choosing one of them along with index 14 would form a strong team.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a Ghost type for better coverage against various types.

Wait, maybe I should focus more on the move sets. For example, index 17 has Reflect which can reduce damage taken.

So, considering all this, I think the best new team would include:

- Index 14: ELECTRIC/DARK with good offensive and defensive moves.

- Index 26: FIGHT/NORMAL with Light Screen to boost defense.

- Index 48: NORMAL with Dragon and Protect for versatility.

This combination provides Electric for consistent damage, Normal/Fighting for strong physical attacks and defense, and another Normal for added defensive support and type coverage.

Alright, I need to help create a new Pokémon team based on the given Roster and previous team performance. Let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the user provided their last battle result: their team lost, with a new Elo of 1089.27. They also mentioned that no past winning-team data is available. So, my task is to choose three Pokémon from the Roster that can maximize their chances in the next battle.

The previous team used indices [14, 26, 48]. I should look into what those Pokémon are:

- Index 14: Type ELECTRIC/DARK, Max HP 107. Moves include Dragon, Accuracy 0.81, Max PP 11, Other, Target Boosts (0,0,0,1,0,0,0,-1), Rock, etc.
- Index 26: Type WATER/ELECTRIC, Max HP 148. Moves include Poison, Power 68, Max PP 9, Physical, Priority 1, Probability 0.51, Disable, etc.
- Index 48: Type WATER, Max HP 128. Moves include Grass, Accuracy 0.99, Max PP 8, Other, Tailwind, Ghost, etc.

Looking at their types, the previous team had Electric and Water types, which are good for coverage. Now, I need to choose a new set that can complement or counterbalance the last loss.

I should consider each Pokémon's type effectiveness, moves, and how they might perform in battle. The goal is to maximize the chances of winning, so I should aim for strong, versatile Pokémon with good stats and reliable moves.

Let me go through the Roster:

Starting from lower indices:

- Index 0: Normal/Ghost, Max HP 102. Moves include Electric and Fight. Could be a solid choice.
- Index 2: Steel/Psychic, Max HP 119. Moves include Bug and Dragon. Good for coverage.
- Index 3: Grass/Fairy, Max HP 67. Might be weaker due to lower HP but has useful moves like Trickroom.
- Index 4: Dark/Psychic, Max HP 129. Moves include Psychic and Self Switch.
- Index 5: Electric, Max HP 142. Strong Electric type with good moves.
- Index 6: Fight/Rock, Max HP 160. Solid physical attacker.
- Index 7: Fairy/Rock, Max HP 34. Seems weak, but has useful moves like Bug and Trickroom.
- Index 8: Poison, Max HP 127. Good poison type with decent moves.
- Index 9: Steel/Fire, Max HP 126. Versatile with Steel and Fire.
- Index 10: Bug, Max HP 131. Strong Bug type with Dragon moves.
- Index 11: Ghost/Fire, Max HP 122. Could be a good offensive choice.
- Index 12: Electric, Max HP 79. Maybe too weak?
- Index 13: Electric, Max HP 83. Also seems weak.
- Index 14: Used last time.
- Index 15: Ground/Electric, Max HP 100. Good for ground and electric moves.
- Index 16: Electric, Max HP 129. Strong Electric type.
- Index 17: Normal/Ground, Max HP 115. Solid choice with good moves.
- Index 18: Bug, Max HP 128. Versatile with Rock and Water moves.
- Index 19: Dark, Max HP 135. Good for dark moves.
- Index 20: Steel/Electric, Max HP 160. Strong all-rounder.
- Index 21: Fairy, Max HP 123. Useful fairy moves.
- Index 22: Rock/Fire, Max HP 134. Strong with fire and rock.
- Index 23: Ice/Fire, Max HP 105. Good for ice and fire.
- Index 24: Ground/ Poison, Max HP 137. Good for ground and poison.
- Index 25: Fairy/Flying, Max HP 130. Versatile fairy moves.
- Index 26: Used last time.
- Index 27: Water/Electric, Max HP 148. Strong choice.
- Index 28: Water/Poison, Max HP 160. Great for water and poison.
- Index 29: Electric, Max HP 160. Very strong electric type.
- Index 30: Dragon, Max HP 70. Maybe too weak?
- Index 31: Steel/Electric, Max HP 133. Strong all-rounder.
- Index 32: Steel/Fairy, Max HP 131. Versatile with good stats.
- Index 33: Electric/Poison, Max HP 127. Good for electric and poison.
- Index 34: Electric, Max HP 113. Decent choice.
- Index 35: Steel, Max HP 112. Solid physical attacker.
- Index 36: Ghost/Steel, Max HP 86. Might be too weak?
- Index 37: Flying, Max HP 115. Useful for flying moves.
- Index 38: Normal, Max HP 126. Good all-rounder with nice stats.
- Index 39: Fire, Max HP 135. Strong fire type.
- Index 40: Normal, Max HP 104. Decent choice.
- Index 41: Ground, Max HP 149. Strong ground type.
- Index 42: Ghost, Max HP 116. Good for ghost moves.
- Index 43: Dragon/Electric, Max HP 114. Versatile with good moves.
- Index 44: Electric, Max HP 159. Very strong electric type.
- Index 45: Ice/Dragon, Max HP 107. Good for ice and dragon.
- Index 46: Water/Poison, Max HP 155. Strong choice.
- Index 47: Steel, Max HP 54. Maybe too weak.
- Index 48: Used last time.
- Index 49: Water, Max HP 128. Strong water type.

Now, considering the previous team's types (Electric/Dark, Water/Electric, Water), I should aim for a mix that covers different types and has strong attackers. Since they lost last time, maybe they need more offensive power or better defensive options.

Looking for high Max HP: Indices 20 (160), 28 (160), 29 (160), 30 (70) – but 30 is Dragon which might be weak. Maybe focus on higher HP to survive battles.

Also, looking at types that weren't covered much in the previous team: Dark was present in one (14). So maybe include another dark type. Also, Fire and Rock are underrepresented.

Looking for strong Electric types: Indices 29, 44, 16, etc., have high Max HP and good movesets.

Also, considering the last result: Elo is down, so maybe they need a more balanced team that can handle various strategies.

Trying to find three with good stats, diverse types, and powerful moves.

Looking at index 20: Steel/Electric, which covers both types and has high HP. Index 28: Water/Poison – great for water and poison, plus high HP. Index 29: Electric, which is a strong attacker. Alternatively, index 44: Electric with even higher Max HP (159). But might be too much.

Alternatively, maybe include a Dragon type for versatility. Index 30: Dragon but low HP. Maybe not the best.

Wait, index 32: Steel/Fairy, high HP and good moves. Also, fairy is a good type for various resistances.

Another option: index 31: Steel/Electric, which is strong with both types.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to pick top 3 based on Max HP:

29 (160), 28 (160), 20 (160). So including these three would give high HP and good coverage. Alternatively, maybe 20, 28, 29.

Another thought: if the last battle was against a team with certain types, maybe avoiding those types now. Since they lost, perhaps their previous team composition wasn't strong enough. Maybe switch to a more defensive or balanced approach.

Wait, the previous team used indices 14 (Electric/Dark), 26 (Water/Electric), and 48 (Normal). So types involved: Electric, Dark, Water, Normal. So maybe include types not in this mix, like Fire, Rock, etc.

Looking for high HP and strong types:

- Index 22: Rock/Fire – high HP and good coverage.
- Index 20: Steel/Electric – versatile.
- Index 29: Electric – strong attacker.

Alternatively, index 20 covers steel and electric. Index 28 covers water and poison. Then maybe a fire type for index 3 or 39. But need to pick from the given.

Wait, but we're limited to three indices each time, so must choose within the Roster provided.

So perhaps choosing 14 (Electric/Dark), 22 (Rock/Fire), and 29 (Electric). That would give coverage of Electric, Dark, Rock, Fire. Alternatively, 20, 28, 29.

I'm not sure which is better. Maybe 20 covers Steel/Electric, which can handle multiple types, 28 covers Water/Poison, and 29 as a strong Electric attacker.

Alternatively, if they lost last time because their team couldn't handle certain resistances or moves, maybe including more versatile types would help. For example, a Ghost type (index 6) could be good for handling various statuses.

But I need to pick from the Roster given and choose three with the highest potential.

Looking at the Max HP:

- 20:160, 28:160, 29:160, 32:131, 44:159, etc. So maybe include 44 (Electric), which has high HP and good moves.

Alternatively, 14, 22, 48 might be a mix of types but 48 is Normal which might not add much except for resistances.

Wait, index 48: Normal, so it covers Normal type attacks and can have some immunities. Maybe that's useful.

But I'm not sure if the team needs more Normal coverage. The previous team had a Normal in their indices (14) but maybe including another would help.

Alternatively, let me think about the last battle: they lost. So perhaps the other team had certain advantages. To counteract, pick Pokémon that can handle those types or have strong moves against them.

But without knowing specifics of the opponent's team, it's hard to tailor. So best is to choose high HP, good movepools, and coverage.

So based on Max HP:

29 (160), 20 (160), 28 (160) are all tied for highest. Then maybe add another with slightly lower but still good stats.

Alternatively, 44:159, which is very close.

But in the Roster, 44 is Electric with high HP and good moves.

So perhaps team would be 14 (Electric/Dark), 22 (Rock/Fire), and 29 (Electric). That covers Electric, Dark, Rock, Fire. Alternatively, 20 (Steel/Electric), 28 (Water/Poison), and 44 (Electric).

Wait, but the user's last result was a loss with Elo 1089.27. So they might need to improve.

Looking for the most powerful team possible.

Another approach: find each Pokémon's effectiveness against others.

But that's too time-consuming without more info.

Alternatively, pick the three highest HP, which are 20,28,29.

So 20: Steel/Electric, 28: Water/Poison, 29: Electric. Or maybe replace 29 with another type for coverage.

Wait, index 14 is Electric/Dark. So including that might give more flexibility.

But the user's previous team used 14,26,48. Maybe avoid using 14 again? Or not necessarily.

Alternatively, to maximize, pick the three best in terms of Max HP:

20,28,29: all have 160 HP except 28 is 160 as well. Wait, no, looking back:

Roster indices and their Max HP:

- 0:102,1:160,2:119,3:67,4:129,5:142,6:160,7:34,8:127,9:126,10:131,11:122,12:79,13:83,14:107,15:100,16:129,17:115,18:128,19:135,20:160,21:123,22:134,23:105,24:137,25:130,26:137,27:148,28:160,29:160,30:70,31:133,32:131,33:127,34:113,35:112,36:86,37:115,38:126,39:135,40:104,41:149,42:116,43:114,44:159,45:107,46:155,47:54,48:160.

So 20,28,29 have Max HP=160. So any of those would be the best to include.

Then next highest are 26:137,31:133,41:149, etc.

Wait, 41 has Max HP=149 which is lower than others but perhaps better in other stats.

But for this problem, I think focusing on highest Max HP is the way to go because higher HP can survive more damage.

So team would be 20 (Steel/Electric, 160), 28 (Water/Poison, 160), and 29 (Electric, 160). All have high HP and Electric typing which might cover each other's weaknesses.

Alternatively, including another type like Steel for added resistance. But 20 is already Steel/Electric.

So perhaps pick the three highest HP:20,28,29.

But wait, in Roster, 0-49 are all available. So including these would be ideal.

Thus, I'll choose ---20, 28, 29--- as the new team.

Okay, so I just lost a battle and need to build a new Pokémon team. My last team had indices [20, 28, 29], but they didn't perform well this time. Let me look at the Roster again and figure out what I should do.

First, I remember that after losing, it's important to analyze where my team was weak. Maybe they weren't tanking or had issues with their moves. Looking at the last team:

- Index 20: Steel/Electric. It has high max HP (160), good moves like Psychic and Dragon, which are versatile.
- Index 28: Water/Toxic. High HP, moves include Ghost, Rain, Electric, etc., which can be useful in certain matchups.
- Index 29: Electric. It has a mix of physical and special attacks with decent accuracy.

I need to replace these three with stronger options. Let me go through the Roster and see what's available.

Looking for types that are strong against my last team or have good versatility:

1. Type Coverage: Maybe add something that covers multiple types, like Dragon or Ghost, which can counter a lot of enemies.
2. High HP: Since I lost, maybe adding more tanky Pokémon would help in future battles.
3. Strong Moves: Look for high-power moves and good accuracy.

Starting with index 0: Normal/Ghost. It has Electric and Fight moves, which are good, but Normal might not be the best type against many enemies. But it's a solid choice because of the moves.

Index 14: Electric/Dark. This could add both Electric for support and Dark, which is strong against Ghosts. Plus, it has Dragon move, which is versatile.

Index 30: Dragon. High HP (70) might be lower than others, but it has good moves like Electric and Rock, plus a Trickroom ability. It's also resistant to many types, so it can act as a tank or contribute with its moves.

So putting it together:
- 0: Normal/Ghost for versatility.
- 14: Electric/Dark for support and type coverage.
- 30: Dragon for tanking and good moves.

I think this setup would give me better coverage and higher chances in the next battle. It's a mix of different types, which is usually strong against various enemies.

Alright, I need to figure out a new Pokémon team based on the given Roster and the previous team's performance. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user provided a lot of Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves. The task is to choose three indices from this list that form the best possible team for the next battle, considering that the last team lost. 

First, I should consider what makes a good Pokémon team. Typically, teams are built around type coverage, balance, and synergy. Since the last team lost, maybe they were weak against certain types or had poor move coverage.

Looking at the previous team, the indices used were [0, 14, 30]. Let me check those:

- Index 0: Type NORMAL/GHOST, Max_HP=102, Moves include ELECTRIC and FIGHT.
- Index 14: Type ELECTRIC/DARK, Max_HP=107, Moves include DRAGON and others.
- Index 30: Type DRAGON, Max_HP=70, Moves include ELECTRIC and ROCK.

So the previous team had Electric/Dark, Normal/Ghost, and Dragon types. Maybe their moves didn't cover all types effectively or weren't strong enough against the opposing team.

Since I need to choose a new team that's better suited for winning, I should look for Pokémon with strong stats, good move sets, and complementary types. Let me go through each template and see which ones stand out.

I'll start by looking for high Max_HP because higher HP means more survivability, which is good in battles. Also, considering the previous loss, maybe adding a strong attacker or a wall could help.

Looking at the Roster:

- Index 20: Type STEEL/ELECTRIC, Max_HP=160. This sounds like a strong tank with Steel and Electric types. Steel resists many attacks, and Electric can deal good damage.
- Index 26: Type FIGHT/NORMAL, Max_HP=137. Normal is versatile, and FIGHT type has good coverage with moves like Fighting moves.
- Index 40: Type NORMAL, Max_HP=104. Normal is a solid choice, but HP isn't the highest.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Dragon type could help if that was weak before. Looking for high-DP (Dragon Power) Pokémon:

- Index 30: Type DRAGON, Max_HP=70. Already used in previous team but might be useful again if not overused.
- Index 45: Type ICE/DRAGON, Max_HP=107. Ice can provide added utility with moves like Reflect or Blizzard.

Wait, but the user's last result was a loss, so maybe adding more defensive types would help prevent future losses. Alternatively, perhaps choosing Pokémon that can exploit weaknesses in the previous team's opponents.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon with high Accuracy and strong moves. For example, index 26 has FIGHT type with high Accuracy on physical moves, which is good for dealing consistent damage.

Let me also consider type coverage. The previous team had Electric/Dark, Normal/Ghost, Dragon. Maybe adding a Steel type would cover more ground, as Steel resists many attacks and can take hits. Index 20 fits that.

Looking at the move sets:

- Index 20: Moves include PSYCHIC, which is good for support or setup.
- Index 26: FIGHT moves like Protect and Light Screen provide defensive synergy.
- Index 40: Normal type with Tailwind might boost team's offensive output.

Alternatively, considering that the last team lost, maybe they needed more offensive presence. So choosing Pokémon with strong attacking moves could help turn the tide in battles.

Another consideration is the previous team's moves. If they had certain types covered weakly, adding Pokémon that can counter those would be beneficial. For example, if their opponents used a lot of Fire or Grass, having counters like Water or Ice could be advantageous.

But without specific information about the opponent's team, it's hard to tailor the team perfectly. So I'll focus on balance and overall strength.

Let me rank the Pokémon by Max HP:

- 20:160, 28:160, etc.
Looking at the indices provided in the Roster, index 20 is STEEL/ELECTRIC with 160 HP, which seems like a strong choice.

Now, considering the previous team's types (Electric/Dark, Normal/Ghost, Dragon), adding another type that isn't covered as much could be beneficial. Maybe Ground or Rock for coverage against Electric and Dragon types.

Wait, index 35 is STEEL, Max_HP=112. Steel can provide good defense but lower HP. Alternatively, index 31 is STEEL/ELECTRIC with higher HP.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the last loss. Maybe the team didn't have enough healing or support moves. Looking for Pokémon that can provide status boosts or healing.

Index 18: Type BUG, Max_HP=128. Moves include Reflect and Water, which could help in defense.
Index 28: Type WATER/POISON, Max_HP=160. Water is a good type for offense and defense, and Poison adds more utility.
Index 32: Type STEEL/FAIRY, Max_HP=131. Steel is great defensively, and Fairy can be useful against certain types.

Alternatively, maybe the previous team lacked a strong wall or healer. So perhaps choosing a Pokémon with high HP and good supportive moves would help.

Another angle is to look for Pokémon that have unique abilities or moves that can turn battles in their favor. For example, index 40 has Tailwind, which boosts the team's attack when used, but it's a Normal type.

I think I need to make a balanced team with strong individual members. Let me consider:

- Index 20: STEEL/ELECTRIC for defense and strong offense.
- Index 26: FIGHT/NORMAL for versatile attacks and defense.
- Index 40: NORMAL with Tailwind for offensive boost.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Ghost type could help with Intimidate or other moves. Looking at index 0 as an example, but I don't know if it's better than others.

Wait, the previous team had indices [0,14,30]. Maybe avoiding types that were underperforming in the last battle would be better. For example, if Dragon was weak because of specific opponent weaknesses, maybe not choosing another Dragon.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a Dark type for better coverage against certain opponents. Index 4 is DARK/PSYCHIC but has Max_HP=129, which is decent.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. The main points are:

1. Choose three Pokémon from the Roster.
2. Maximize their chances in the next battle based on previous loss and no prior winning data.
3. Only use the info given: last result was a loss with Elo 1041, and previous team was [0,14,30].

So perhaps the best approach is to pick high HP Pokémon that have strong moves across different types.

Looking at index 20 (STEL/ELEC, 160HP), index 26 (FIGHT/NORMAL,137HP), index 28 (WATER/POISON,160HP). These seem like strong choices with good HP and versatile types.

Alternatively, maybe picking index 14 (ELEC/DARK) again could be beneficial if Dark is needed. But I don't know the opponent's weaknesses.

Wait, but since it's a simplified Pokémon game, perhaps each team should have types that can cover multiple weaknesses. For example, having Electric for neutralizing Grass and Water, Steel for coverage against Rock and Fire, and Normal/Fighting for versatility.

So maybe the optimal team would be:

- Steel/Electric (high defense, strong offense)
- Normal/Fighting (versatile attacks and good defensive moves like Protect)
- Poison/Water (offensive and supportive with status moves)

Looking at the Roster, that would correspond to indices 20, 26, 28.

Alternatively, another combination could be better. For example, index 14 (ELEC/DARK), which has high HP and useful types, plus others.

But without knowing the opponent's team type weaknesses, it's hard to say definitively.

In the end, I think the best approach is to select the highest HP Pokémon with strong moves across different types to maximize versatility and defense.

Alright, so I need to help create a new Pokémon team based on the given Roster and previous team. The user provided a lot of data, so first, I should parse through it carefully.

The user mentioned that their last team lost, with an Elo of 1015.24. They also noted that there's no past winning-team data available. So, this is their first loss, which might mean they need to adjust their strategy.

Looking at the previous team indices: [20, 26, 28]. Let me check what types these are:

- Index 20: Type is STEEL/ELECTRIC
- Index 26: Type is FIGHT/NORMAL
- Index 28: Type is WATER/POISON

So, their last team had a mix of Steel, Electric, Normal, and Water/Poison. Maybe they faced certain types that were strong against them, leading to the loss.

Now, I need to choose three new Pokémon from the Roster. The goal is to maximize chances in the next battle. So, I should consider what types are currently dominant or have been performing well, or maybe types that can counter the previous team's weaknesses.

Looking through the Roster, I notice several options:

- Index 0: Normal/Ghost
- Index 1: Ghost/Electric
- Index 2: Steel/Psychic
- Index 3: Grass/Fairy
- Index 4: Dark/Psychic
- Index 5: Electric
- Index 6: Fight/Rock
- Index 7: Fairy/Rock
- Index 8: Poison
- Index 9: Steel/Fire
- Index 10: Bug
- Index 11: Ghost/Fire
- Index 12: Electric
- Index 13: Electric
- Index 14: Electric/Dark
- Index 15: Ground/Electric
- Index 16: Electric
- Index 17: Normal/Ground
- Index 18: Bug
- Index 19: Dark
- Index 20: Steel/Electric (already used last time)
- Index 21: Fairy
- Index 22: Rock/Fire
- Index 23: Ice/Fire
- Index 24: Ground/Poison
- Index 25: Fairy/Flying
- Index 26: Fight/Normal (used last time)
- Index 27: Water/Electric
- Index 28: Water/Poison (used last time)
- Index 29: Electric
- Index 30: Dragon

I should avoid using the same types that were in the previous team if they are weak against certain types. For example, since their last team lost, perhaps their moveset or typings weren't effective.

Looking for types that can cover multiple weaknesses or have strong moves. Also, considering HP and accuracy might be important.

Let me think about what types are not present in the previous team but could be strong:

- Dragon (Index 30) is a single-type option with decent stats.
- Fairy types (like Index 21, 25) can be good against Dragon and Dark.
- Electric/Dark (Index 14) could be useful for coverage.
- Ground types (Index 15, 24) might provide good defensive coverage.
- Rock/Fire (Index 22) offers some versatility with Fire moves.

Also, considering that they lost before, maybe they need a more balanced team or one that can exploit their previous opponents' weaknesses.

Looking at the types of the previous team:

- Steel/Electric: Can handle Electric and Steel types well.
- Fight/Normal: Covers Normal and Fighting moves.
- Water/Poison: Provides Water and Poison coverage.

If the last battle involved certain types, maybe the new team should have counters for those. For example, if they lost to Fire-type attacks, having Ice or Rock types could help.

But without specific info on the previous battle's opponents, it's hard to tailor the team exactly. So, I need a general strategy that maximizes versatility and offensive power.

Let me consider picking a Dragon (Index 30) for its high attack and range of moves. Then, maybe an Electric/Dark (14) for coverage against both Electric and Dark types. Finally, a Fairy (21) to handle Dragon with her moves.

Alternatively, I could go for Ground (15) for solid defensive stats and multi-type coverage. But since the user's last team had Water/Poison, adding another Ground type might not be necessary if they already have it.

Wait, actually, index 28 is Water/Poison, which was part of their previous team. So perhaps they can avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Another approach: Electric (29) is a strong attacker with good moves. Pairing it with a Ghost/Fire (11) for coverage against Fire and Ghost types. Then, a Fairy (21) to round out the team with good support moves.

Alternatively, using Dragon (30), Electric/Dark (14), and maybe a Fairy (21). This combination would have strong offensive capabilities across multiple types.

Considering HP, index 30 has Max_HP=70, which is on the lower side. Maybe better to pick a Pokémon with higher HP for survivability.

Looking at index 20: Steel/Electric with 160 HP. But they used it before. Index 26: Fight/Normal, also used. So perhaps avoid those unless necessary.

Wait, the user's instructions say not to include any extra text, just the indices. So I need to choose three without explanation.

Based on my analysis, I think picking indices 14 (Electric/Dark), 30 (Dragon), and 21 (Fairy) would be a strong team. Electric/Dark provides both Electric and Dark coverage, Dragon is a powerful attacker, and Fairy can handle Dragon with her moves.

Alternatively, if they need more defensive options, index 15 (Ground/Electric) could be useful, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the previous team had a Water/Poison type. Maybe adding another type that covers different weaknesses would help. But without knowing the exact opponents, it's hard to say.

In any case, choosing a mix of types that cover multiple bases and have strong offensive capabilities seems like the way to go.

Okay, so I need to help choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The user is starting fresh since it's their first battle, and they want to maximize their chances in the next battle. They provided a list of 50 Pokémon templates with types, max HP, and moves.

First, I should consider what makes a good team. Usually, you want a balance between offense, defense, and support moves. Since it's their first battle, maybe focusing on strong attackers and some supportive moves could be beneficial.

Looking at the rosters, I need to pick three Pokémon that can cover multiple types and have strong moves. Let me go through each template:

- Index 0: Normal type with Fire, Special, Steel moves. Seems solid.
- Index 1: Ghost/Normal with Bug, Water, etc. Good versatility.
- Index 2: Fight type with Dark, Dragon, etc. Strong physical attacker.
- Index 3: Ice/Ground, which is good for defensive coverage and Ground moves.
- Index 4: Grass with Electric, Fire, etc. Good offensive moves.
- Index 5: Psych/Rock with Ghost, Water, etc. Versatile.
- Index 6: Ground/Flying with Psychic, Ice, etc. Strong support.
- Index 7: Dark/Steel with Electric, Normal, etc. Good defensive and offensive.
- Index 8: Flying with Grass, Dragon, etc. Solid attacker.
- Index 9: Fairy with Dark, Fire, etc. Interesting moves.
- Index 10: Electric/Fire with Water, Bug, etc. Versatile.
- Index 11: Steel with Dragon, Ice, etc. Strong physical and special attacks.
- Index 12: Dark with Rock, Ground, etc. Good defensive moves.
- Index 13: Electric/Ghost with Rock, Ice, etc. Supportive and offensive.
- Index 14: Water/Psychic with Normal, Ghost, etc. Strong support.
- Index 15: Dragon/Fight with Steel, Fire, etc. Physical attacker.
- Index 16: Ice with Ice, Dark moves. Good for specific types.
- Index 17: Water with Fire, Ice, etc. Supportive.
- Index 18: Ground with Dark, Psychic, etc. Strong physical and support.
- Index 19: Ground/Dragon with Fire, Bug, etc. Versatile attacker.
- Index 20: Fight with Ground, Dark, etc. Physical and defense.
- Index 21: Ground/Electric with Bug, etc. Supportive moves.
- Index 22: Water/Normal with Flying, Grass, etc. Solid attackers.
- Index 23: Fire/Psychic with Dragon, etc. Good offensive.
- Index 24: Ghost/POISON with Psychic, Sand, etc. Versatile.
- Index 25: Poison with Steel, Ice, etc. Strong defensive and offensive.
- Index 26: Fairy/DRAGON with Psychic, etc. Supportive and attacker.
- Index 27: Dragon with Ghost moves. Good for specific types.
- Index 28: Dark/Fire with Normal, GHOST, etc. Versatile.
- Index 29: Fairy/Steel with Water, Fire, etc. Strong support.
- Index 30: Rock with Dragon, Water, etc. Solid attacker and type coverage.
- Index 31: Psych with Normal, Sand, etc. Supportive moves.
- Index 32: Grass with Ground, Steel, etc. Balanced attacker.
- Index 33: Ghost/Steel with Ground, Electric, etc. Good support.
- Index 34: Dark with Flying, Rock, etc. Versatile and offensive.
- Index 35: Bug with Fight, Steel, etc. Strong physical moves.
- Index 36: Ground with Bug, Grass, etc. Supportive and attacker.
- Index 37: Psych with Bug, Fire, etc. Good offensive.
- Index 38: Ghost/Normal with Fire, Psychic, etc. Versatile.
- Index 39: Electric with Normal, Bug, etc. Supportive moves.
- Index 40: Fairy/Water with Bug, Fire, etc. Strong attacker.
- Index 41: Bug/Ground with Flying, Dark, etc. Supportive and offensive.
- Index 42: Grass/Steel with Ground, Fly, etc. Balanced team.
- Index 43: Normal/Fight with Ice, Ground, etc. Physical attackers.
- Index 44: Steel with Fire, Rock, etc. Strong defensive and offensive.
- Index 45: Fairy with Rock, Psych, etc. Supportive moves.
- Index 46: Electric/Steel with Fire, Ghost, etc. Versatile team.
- Index 47: Bug/Dark with Normal, GHOST, etc. Good attackers.
- Index 48: Fairy/Rock with Dark, Electric, etc. Supportive and offensive.
- Index 49: Grass with Fire, Ice, etc. Strong attacker.

Now, considering the first battle, I want a team that can handle various types and has strong moves. Maybe picking one strong attacker, one support, and another versatile Pokémon.

Looking at index 30: Rock type with Dragon, Water, which are good for coverage. It's a solid choice for defensive and offensive moves.

Index 14: Water/Psychic with Normal, Ghost, etc. Good support and versatile.

Index 49: Grass with Fire, Ice, etc. Strong attacker and covers multiple types.

So combining these would give a team that can handle various type effectiveness and has strong moves to deal damage.

Alright, I need to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster will give me the best chance of winning the next battle, considering that my last team lost. The previous team used indices [30, 14, 49], and now I have to choose a new set.

First, let's recall what each Pokémon brings to the table:

- **PkmTemplate 0**: Type NORMAL, Max_HP=104, Moves include FIRE, Power 140, etc.

- **3**: ICE/GROUND, Max_HP=103, includes GHOST, Tailwind, etc.
- **4**: GRASS, Max_HP=94, with ELECTRIC, Reflect, etc.
- **5**: PSYCHIC/ROCK, Max_HP=75, has some good moves like Power 101.
- **6**: GROUND/FLYING, Max_HP=150, includes Psych up and other strong abilities.
- **7**: DARK/STEEL, Max_HP=142, with Light Screen and Protect.

- **11**: STEEL, Max_HP=77, with some strong moves like Power 98.
- **12**: DARK, Max_HP=154, has FIGHT and GROUND moves.
- **13**: ELECTRIC/GHOST, Max_HP=106, includes Ice and Steel.
- **14**: WATER/PSYCHIC, Max_HP=160, with Normal and Ghost moves.
- **15**: DRAGON/FIGHT, Max_HP=94, includes Dragon and Ghost moves.
- **16**: ICE, Max_HP=82, has some good accuracy on physical moves.
- **17**: WATER, Max_HP=100, with Fire and Ice.
- **18**: GROUND, Max_HP=120, includes Dark and Psych up.
- **19**: GROUND/DRAGON, Max_HP=160, great for Dragon-type moves.
- **20**: FIGHT, Max_HP=125, has Ground and Protect.
- **21**: GROUND/ELECTRIC, Max_HP=101, with Bug and Protect.
- **22**: WATER/NORMAL, Max_HP=126, includes Flying and Rock.
- **23**: FIRE/PSYCHIC, Max_HP=95, good for Dragon moves.
- **24**: GHOST/POISON, Max_HP=105, includes Sand and Fight.
- **25**: POISON, Max_HP=125, has Steel and Reflect.
- **26**: FAIRY/DRAGON, Max_HP=95, with Psych up and Protect.
- **27**: DRAGON, Max_HP=92, includes Ghost and some boosts.
- **28**: DARK/FIRE, Max_HP=113, includes Reflect and Ghost.
- **29**: FAIRY/STEEL, Max_HP=108, includes Water and Steel.
- **30**: ROCK, Max_HP=113, has Dragon and Water moves.
- **31**: PSYCHIC, Max_HP=126, includes Normal and Sand.
- **32**: GRASS, Max_HP=116, has Ground and Protect.
- **33**: GHOST/STEEL, Max_HP=89, with Ground and Electric.
- **34**: DARK, Max_HP=103, includes Flying and Rock.
- **35**: BUG, Max_HP=156, good for Fight and Trickroom.
- **36**: GROUND, Max_HP=135, includes Bug and Tailwind.
- **37**: PSYCHIC, Max_HP=97, with Bug and Fire.
- **38**: GHOST/NORMAL, Max_HP=160, has Psych up and Normal moves.
- **39**: ELECTRIC, Max_HP=160, includes Steel and Protect.
- **40**: FAIRY/WATER, Max_HP=138, includes Bug and Fire.
- **41**: BUG/GROUND, Max_HP=119, with Flying and Fight.
- **42**: GRASS/STEEL, Max_HP=147, has Ground and Dragon.
- **43**: NORMAL/FIGHT, Max_HP=135, includes Ice and Ground.
- **44**: STEEL, Max_HP=160, includes Fire and Rock.
- **45**: FAIRY, Max_HP=136, with Rock and Psych up.
- **46**: ELECTRIC/STEEL, Max_HP=122, includes Fire and Psychic.
- **47**: BUG/DARK, Max_HP=81, has Normal and Ghost.
- **48**: FAIRY/ROCK, Max_HP=122, includes Dark and Electric.
- **49**: GRASS, Max_HP=95, with Fire and Dragon.

Now, considering the last loss, I need to build a team that can counter whatever moves the opponent might use. Maybe focusing on types that are strong against each other or have good coverage.

Looking at previous choices [30,14,49], which are ROCK (30), WATER/PSYCHIC (14), and GRASS (49). Maybe next time I should stick with similar types but perhaps different templates to maximize the chances.

I should look for Pokémon that have strong offensive moves, high Max HP, and good defensive moves like Reflect or Light Screen. Also, having a mix of types can help cover more weaknesses.

Let me consider some top candidates:

- **19**: GROUND/DRAGON, Max_HP=160, with Dragon moves which are strong against Ice and Steel.
- **35**: BUG, Max_HP=156, has good multi-type coverage and Trickroom.
- **36**: GROUND, Max_HP=135, includes Bug and Tailwind, which can help set up multiple turns.
- **38**: GHOST/NORMAL, Max_HP=160, great for setting up with moves like Haunt or Spirit Breaker.
- **39**: ELECTRIC, Max_HP=160, includes Steel and Protect, which are versatile.
- **40**: FAIRY/WATER, Max_HP=138, includes Bug and Fire, which can be strong against Psychic and Rock types.

I also need to avoid having too many same-type Pokémon, as that could leave me vulnerable. So maybe pick from different types like Ground, Dragon, Electric, etc.

Looking at the previous team's indices [30 (ROCK), 14 (WATER/PSYCHIC), 49 (GRASS)], perhaps replacing one with another type might help.

Let me check the Max HP and moves:

- **19**: GROUND/DRAGON has high HP and good Dragon-type moves.
- **35**: BUG, very high Max HP and strong offensive moves.
- **36**: GROUND, great for Bug and Ground moves.
- **38**: GHOST/NORMAL, versatile with Normal and Ghost types.
- **39**: ELECTRIC, solid all-rounder.

If I pick 19, 35, 36: three different types (Ground/Dragon, Bug, Ground), but maybe too much Ground. Alternatively, 19, 35, 38 would have Ground/Dragon, Bug, and Ghost/Normal, which covers a lot of type coverage.

Another option is 39, 14, 49: Electric, Water/Psychic, Grass. That could be good for versatility.

Wait, but the previous team used 30 (Rock), 14 (Water/PSYCHIC), 49 (Grass). Maybe I can replace one with a stronger type. For example, replacing Rock (30) with Dragon (19 or 15) could add more Dragon-type strength, which is strong against Ice and Steel.

Alternatively, adding an Electric type like 39 to provide coverage against Grass and Water, but also have Protect for defense.

Hmm, it's a bit tricky. Let me list possible combinations:

1. [30 (ROCK), 14 (WATER/PSYCHIC), 49 (GRASS)] – same as before.
2. Replace Rock with Dragon: [19 (GROUND/DRAGON), 14, 49].
3. Add Electric and replace two: Maybe [39 (ELECTRIC), 14, 49].
4. Or mix of Ground/Dragon, Bug, Normal/Ghost.

I think the key is to have a good variety of types that can cover each other's weaknesses. Also, high Max HP helps in surviving longer.

Looking at stats, I also need to consider moves like Protect for defense or Reflect for counterattacks.

Perhaps picking:

- **38** (GHOST/NORMAL) for Normal and Ghost moves.
- **39** (ELECTRIC) for versatile coverage and Protect.
- **19** (GROUND/DRAGON) for Ground and Dragon moves.

That would give me three strong templates with different types, good offensive moves, and solid defensive options like Protect and Reflect (from 38? Wait, no, 38's moves are FIRE and PSYCHIC. Maybe another choice for Reflect.)

Wait, checking the roster:

- **0**: Normal with Reflect.
- **6**: Ground/Flying has GROUND which might help, but not Reflect.

If I include a template with Reflect or Light Screen, that could be beneficial.

Looking at other options, perhaps including 19 (Ground/Dragon), 35 (Bug), and 39 (Electric). This would give:

- Ground for Grass, Rock, Electric types.
- Dragon to counter Ice, Steel, etc.
- Bug for coverage against Fighting, Psychic, etc.
- Electric for versatility and Protect.

Alternatively, maybe replace 35 with a different type like Normal or Ghost.

Wait, but 35 is BUG, which is strong against Grass, Psychic, Dark, etc. It might be useful in the current meta.

I think the best approach is to pick three templates that cover a variety of types, have high HP, and useful moves.

Looking at recent data:

The last time I used [30 (ROCK), 14 (WATER/PSYCHIC), 49 (GRASS)], which are Rock, Water/Psychic, Grass. Maybe keeping some of these but replacing others with stronger templates.

Alternatively, picking all three as high HP with strong multi-type coverage.

Another angle: since the last result was a loss, I might need to improve the team's ability to win, so perhaps include more offensive power or better defensive moves like Protect and Reflect.

After considering all possibilities, I think the best new team would be:

- **38** (GHOST/NORMAL): For Normal-type attacks and Ghost resists, plus moves like Haunt and Spirit Breaker.
- **39** (ELECTRIC): For Electric coverage and Protect, which is great for defense.
- **19** (GROUND/DRAGON): For Ground and Dragon-type attacks.

This combination covers multiple types: Normal, Electric, Ground/Dragon. It has good offensive moves and solid defensive options like Protect.

So the indices would be 38,39,19.

Alright, so I need to figure out a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, the Roster includes all the possible Pokémon templates with their types, Max HP, and moves. The previous team indices were [38, 39, 19], and last time we won. Our Elo is now 1198.71. So, I need to choose a new set of three Pokémon from this roster that can maximize our chances in the next battle.

I remember that in Pokémon battles, having type coverage is crucial because it allows you to counter different types your opponent might use. Also, having high accuracy and powerful moves can be advantageous. Since we won last time, maybe the previous team's types were effective, but I need to see what's strong in this new roster.

Looking at the Roster, let me scan through each template to find strong candidates.

Starting with index 38: Type is Ghost/Normal, Max HP 160. Its moves include Fire, Power 66, Max PP 9, Special, Probability 0.53, Tailwind, Psychic, Power 126, Accuracy 0.97, etc. It seems like it has decent stats and some powerful moves.

Index 39: Type is Electric, Max HP 160. Moves include Normal, Max PP 12, Stealth Rock, Bug, Power 96, etc. That's a solid Electric type with good coverage.

Index 19: Type Ground/Dragon, Max HP 160. Moves like Fire, Power 119, Max PP 15, Physical, Probability 0.15, Change Type, Tailwind, Bug, and so on. This Pokémon looks strong with high HP and powerful physical moves.

Now, considering the previous team won with [38, 39, 19], maybe those are still good. But let me see if there's something better in the roster that I might have missed.

Looking further, index 14 is Water/Psychic, Max HP 160. It has Normal, Max PP 11, Other, Priority 1, Heal 0.33, G Ghost, etc. That could be a good Water type with healing ability.

Index 40: Fairy/Water, Max HP 138. Moves include Bug, Accuracy 0.91, Max PP 12, Trickroom, Fire, Power 119, etc. It has strong fairy moves and a good Water type.

Wait, but I need to pick three that work well together. Let me check their types:

38: Ghost/Normal
39: Electric
19: Ground/Dragon

So, Normal, Electric, Ground/Dragon. That covers multiple types which can be effective against various opponents. Also, having both Normal and Electric gives good coverage.

Alternatively, if I pick 14 (Water/Psychic), that adds Water to the team, which is another type. But then maybe we have more specific coverage. However, it's not clear if that's better than the previous team.

Another thought: sometimes, having a Dragon type can be strong because of its moves like Tailwind and Power Boost. Index 19 has Dragon, so that might be beneficial in certain matchups.

Also, considering HP, all three have Max HP around 160 or more, which is good for durability.

I should also consider the accuracy and power of their moves. For example, index 38 has a Psychic move with high accuracy (0.97), which can be useful. Index 39 has Electric moves that might complement well in battles.

Wait, but maybe including a Fairy type could be better? Looking at index 49: Grass, Max HP 95. It has Fire, Max PP 10, Stealth Rock, Ice, etc. But I'm not sure if Grass is the best type to include here unless we expect a lot of Grass opponents.

Alternatively, index 14 (Water/Psychic) could add Water and Psychic types, which can be useful against certain opponents.

But since the last team won with 38,39,19, maybe sticking with what worked before is safer. However, I should check if there are better options in the roster that could improve our chances.

Looking at index 44: Steel, Max HP 160. It has Fire, Power 66, Tailwind, Rock, etc. That's a solid Steel type, which can be useful for coverage against Fire and Rock types.

Index 35: Bug, Max HP 156. Moves include Fight, Power 110, etc. That could provide Bug resistance and offense.

But I need three that work together. Maybe combining high HP, good moves, and complementary types.

Wait, maybe index 14 (Water/Psychic), 38 (Ghost/Normal), and 39 (Electric) would be a good mix. Water for support, Normal/Ghost for versatility, and Electric for offensive moves.

Alternatively, if I go with the previous team, which worked well before, maybe that's still optimal.

I think it's better to stick with tried-and-true combinations unless there's a clear better option. So, perhaps 38,39,19 are good choices.

Okay, so I need to help this user build a new Pokémon team based on their previous loss and the given roster. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user lost their last battle with an Elo of 1183.60. Their previous winning team used indices [19, 38, 39]. Now, they're looking to rebuild using the Roster provided, which lists 49 Pokémon templates each with Type, Max_HP, and Moves.

First, I should analyze what types were effective or ineffective in their last loss. The last team had indices 38, 39, and 19. Let me check those:

- 38: Ghost/Normal
- 39: Electric
- 19: Ground/Dragon

So their last team was a mix of Ghost/Normal, Electric, and Ground/Dragon types. Since they lost, maybe the opposing team had counters for these types.

Now, looking at the Roster, I need to choose three Pokémon that can complement each other, possibly covering different types or strengths to maximize chances in the next battle.

I should consider what types are strong against others. For example, Electric is good against Ground and Water. Dragon types are versatile, as they resist many types and have access to Dragon moves which are often powerful.

Looking at the indices provided, 19 is a Ground/Dragon type, which can be a solid choice because Ground resists many attacks, and Dragon has strong offensive capabilities. Also, it's not too high in HP, which might allow for more aggressive play.

Next, considering support types. Electric (39) is good for supporting because of its moves like Thunderwave or other supportive moves that can disrupt opponents.

For the third Pokémon, maybe a Ghost type could be useful, as they have moves like Haunt and are strong against Normal types. However, looking at index 38, it's a Ghost/Normal, but since that team lost, perhaps adding another Ghost type could provide more defensive or offensive options.

Wait, but the user already used index 38 before, which was part of their losing team. Maybe using a different Ghost type would be better. Let me check other Ghost types in the Roster: indices like 1 (Normal/Ghost), 12 (Dark), 22 (Water/Normal?), 27 (Dragon), 28 (Dark/Fire?), 34 (Dark), etc.

Alternatively, maybe a Rock type could be good because Rock resists Ground and covers weaknesses. For example, index 30 is Rock with moves that include Dragon, which could pair well with the Ground/Dragon in 19.

But considering support, Electric is strong, so index 39 seems like a solid choice for support moves like Thunderwave or others.

Now, choosing three: 19 (Ground/Dragon), 39 (Electric). For the third, perhaps another Dragon type for versatility, but I don't see other Dragon types besides 15 and 27. Index 15 is Dragon/Fight, which might be useful. But if I choose index 19 again, that's not allowed as we need three different indices.

Wait, no, each time you can use any in the Roster, regardless of previous choices unless specified otherwise. So perhaps choosing 19, 39, and another type like Electric or Dragon.

Alternatively, maybe a Grass type could be useful for coverage against Fire and Water. But I'm not sure.

Looking at index 14: Water/Psychic. That could provide water resistance and some psychic moves which are good against Fighting types. Or index 40: Fairy/Water, which might be versatile.

But perhaps going with a mix of Dragon, Electric, and Ghost would cover multiple type advantages. So maybe 19 (Ground/Dragon), 39 (Electric), and 1 (Normal/Ghost).

Wait, but index 38 is also a Ghost/Normal, which was part of the previous losing team. Maybe using that again isn't ideal since it contributed to the loss.

So perhaps better to choose other types. Let me think about each Pokémon's moves and how they can support each other.

Index 19: Ground/Dragon
Moves include Fire, Power 119 (Physical), Change Type, GROUND, etc.
It's a solid attacker with good HP, so it can take hits and dish out damage.

Index 39: Electric
Moves like Normal, Stealth Rock, Bug, Protect, etc. It can set up hazards and provide supportive moves.

For the third Pokémon, maybe something that can cover weaknesses or add more offensive power. Perhaps a Dark type for resistances and boosts. Index 12 is Dark with good moves, but it's not in the previous team.

Alternatively, index 14: Water/Psychic. It has Heal, which could be useful, and Water is strong against Ground and Electric, which are already covered by 19 and 39.

Wait, but if I pick 19 (Ground/Dragon), 39 (Electric), and 14 (Water/Psychic), that gives me a mix of types with some support and healing.

Alternatively, index 40: Fairy/Water. It can provide Fairy moves which are good against Dragon and Dark types, and Water for resistance against Electric and Ground.

I think I need to balance the team's type coverage and offensive/defensive capabilities. Maybe selecting 19 (Ground/Dragon), 39 (Electric), and 14 (Water/Psychic) gives a well-rounded team with support, healing, and type advantages.

Alternatively, perhaps picking index 19, 39, and another type like Fire or Rock for more coverage. But without knowing the exact opponent types, it's hard to say.

Wait, in the previous battle, they lost, so maybe their last opponents had certain weaknesses that they didn't exploit. Perhaps choosing Pokémon with strong moves against those types would be better.

But since I don't know the exact opponent team, I have to make an educated guess based on common strategies. Ground is generally strong, Electric is versatile, and adding a Water/Psychic gives healing and resistance against Fire and Electric.

So I think the best choice is 19, 39, and 14.

Okay, so I need to help build a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The last battle was lost, and I have access to a roster of 50 Pokémon templates. My goal is to choose three that will maximize my chances next time.

First, let me look at the previous team: indices [19, 39, 14]. So the last team used Pokémon from positions 19, 39, and 14.

Looking up each template:

- PkmTemplate 19: GROUND/DRAGON with decent stats and some good moves.
- PkmTemplate 39: ELECTRIC with high Max HP but maybe not the best move set.
- PkmTemplate 14: WATER/PSYCHIC, which is a strong attacker.

Since they lost last time, I need to find better options. The new team should probably have stronger attackers and maybe better defensive types.

Looking through the roster, I'm searching for Pokémon that can deal high damage, have good accuracy, and cover different types to avoid weaknesses. Maybe focusing on type coverage like having a Ghost or Steel type for versatility.

I see PkmTemplate 35 is BUG with high Max HP and strong moves. That could be a solid choice. Also, PkmTemplate 36 is GROUND with some good defensive stats and strong physical attacks. And PkmTemplate 49 is GRASS with some powerful moves like Power 130.

Wait, but maybe I should check their individual strengths. Let me compare:

- Template 35: BUG, high HP, strong physical moves, including FIGHT which can deal damage.
- Template 36: GROUND, good accuracy and physical attacks.
- Template 49: GRASS with a powerful flying move and some good PP.

Putting them together, these three might provide coverage for different types and have strong offensive moves. They also complement each other well in terms of type matchups. I think this combination could perform better than the previous team that lost.

Okay, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their last loss and the given roster. Let me break down what they provided.

First, the previous team lost, which means they might want to switch up some of their strategies or replace weaker members. The last result was an Elo of 1149.38, so it's not super high, indicating that the team wasn't very strong before. 

The previous team used indices [35, 36, 49]. Let me look at those templates:

- Template 35 is a BUG type with Max HP 156 and some decent moves like Power 110, which seems pretty strong.
- Template 36 is GROUND type with Max HP 135 and moves like Power 129, which is also quite strong.
- Template 49 is GRASS type with Max HP 95. The Grass type isn't the strongest here, and with a lower HP compared to others, maybe it's not as effective.

So maybe replacing the weakest member first would be a good strategy. The Grass type (template 49) has a lower HP and doesn't seem to have very powerful moves. Maybe choosing a stronger type would help.

Looking at the roster, I see a lot of types like Electric, Fire, Ice, etc. Let me think about which types are strong against others or have high accuracy or power. 

Template 30 is ROCK with Max HP 113 and some solid moves. Rock can be effective against things like Water and Grass, so that could be useful.

Also, Template 14 is WATER/PSYCHIC with high HP of 160. This might provide a strong water type which is good for counterattacks or support.

Additionally, Template 17 is WATER with Max HP 100. Wait, but Template 14 already covers Water, maybe better to have someone else.

Wait, no, the user needs three types, so let me see what's best. Maybe Template 30 (Rock) could be a good choice because Rock resists many common attacks and can handle multiple types.

Another option is Template 35, which is BUG, but since the last team lost, maybe adding a stronger type would help.

Wait, I also see that Template 26 is FAIRY/DRAGON with Max HP 95. Dragon types are strong against Ice and Fairy, so maybe that could be useful for coverage.

Alternatively, Template 30 seems solid because Rock can take hits and dish out damage. Also, the user's last team lost, so maybe adding a more offensive or defensive type would help.

Wait, but I have to pick three indices without repeats. So, if I choose 30 (Rock), perhaps another strong type like Electric or something else.

Looking at Template 39: ELECTRIC with Max HP 160 and some powerful moves. That might be a good choice as Electric is versatile against Grass, Water, etc.

But then again, maybe the user's last loss was due to specific weaknesses, so choosing types that can exploit common Pokémon strengths could help.

Wait, another approach is to look for high HP templates because if the previous team lost, maybe having higher HP could make a difference. 

Looking at the list:

- Template 17: WATER with Max HP 100
- Template 14: WATER/PSYCHIC with 160
- Template 26: FAIRY/DRAGON with 95
- Template 39: ELECTRIC with 160

So, higher HP is better. So maybe choosing 14 (WATER/PSYCHIC), 30 (ROCK), and another strong type.

Alternatively, the user's last team might have had certain types that performed well or poorly. Since their last result was a loss, perhaps their previous team composition wasn't optimal, so they need to adjust.

Wait, also considering the moves each Pokémon has. High accuracy and powerful moves can really make a difference in battles.

Looking at Template 26: FAIRY/DRAGON has Power 92 and some strong moves. But HP is lower at 95.

Template 30: ROCK with Max HP 113 and some solid moves, including Power 75 which isn't the highest but still decent.

Hmm, maybe it's better to go for higher HP first. So Template 14 (160) and Template 39 (160), both high HP. Then perhaps another strong type like Rock or Electric.

Wait, but I can only choose three types. So, maybe 14 (Water/Psychic), 30 (Rock), and 39 (Electric). But that might be too spread out.

Alternatively, choosing 14, 35 (BUG), and 36 (GROUND). Bug is good against Grass and Psychic, Ground is good against Electric and Rock, so it could cover multiple types.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the user's last loss was because they didn't have enough type coverage or strong attackers. So adding a strong attacker like Template 35 (BUG) with Power 110 and high PP would be beneficial.

So, putting it all together: The previous team had [35,36,49]. The user lost, so maybe replace the weaker members. 49 is Grass with lower HP, so replace that with something stronger. Then add two others that can complement each other.

Looking at Template 30 (Rock) which is strong and has decent HP. Also, Template 14 (Water/Psychic) is strong with high HP and good moves. So maybe the new team would be [35,36,30]. Wait, but 36 was in the previous team, so maybe replacing that as well.

Alternatively, let's think about type coverage: Rock covers multiple types, Bug covers Grass and Psychic, and Water covers Fire and Ice. That gives a good range of coverage.

So perhaps the best new team is [35 (BUG),30 (ROCK),14 (WATER/PSYCHIC)].

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a scenario where they need to form a new Pokémon team based on previous performance and the given roster. My task is to help them choose the best three Pokémon from the available templates.

First, I'll review the information given:

- **Last Result**: Their last team lost, and their Elo is now 1130.13.
- **Previous Team**: The indices used were [35, 30, 14].
- **Roster**: A comprehensive list of 49 Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves.

The goal is to select a new team that maximizes their chances in the next battle. Since it's a simplified Pokémon version, I'll need to focus on the strengths each Pokémon can bring based on their types, moves, and stats.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **Understand the Last Team Composition**:
   - The previous indices used were 35, 30, and 14.
   - Looking up these templates:
     - Index 35: Type BUG, Max HP 156, Moves include FIGHT, Power 110, etc.
     - Index 30: Type ROCK, Max HP 113, Moves include DRAGON, Power 75, etc.
     - Index 14: Type WATER/PSYCHIC, Max HP 160, Moves include NORMAL, Power 53, etc.

   So the last team had a mix of types: BUG, ROCK, and WATER/PSYCHIC. This setup might have been effective, but since they lost, there's room for improvement.

2. **Identify Weaknesses**:
   - Maybe their moveset was inadequate against certain types.
   - Perhaps their type coverage wasn't optimal for dealing with common opponents.

3. **Analyze the Roster**:
   I need to look for Pokémon that can complement each other, covering different types and providing strong offensive/defensive capabilities.

4. **Prioritize High HP and Effective Moves**:
   Higher Max HP usually means better survivability, which is crucial in battles.
   Moves with high accuracy, powerful damage, or useful status moves are advantageous.

5. **Consider Synergy**:
   The selected Pokémon should work well together. For example, having a wallbreaker to open up opponents, a cleaner to finish off weakened foes, and a setter to support the team.

6. **Check for Type Advantages**:
   Each type has its strengths against others. For example, Rock resists Water, Fire beats Ice, etc.

Now, I'll go through each step in more detail.

**Step 1: Analyze Previous Team**

- **BUG (35)**: Good versatility with moves like FIGHT and Power 110. Bug is strong against Grass, but weak to Electric and Fire.
- **ROCK (30)**: Solid defender with moves like Protect and Stone Edge. Rock resists Water and Ice.
- **WATER/PSYCHIC (14)**: Can heal and has Normal moves, which are good for supporting. However, Psych is weak against Dark and Ghost.

**Weaknesses Identified**:
- The team might struggle against Electric types due to Bug's weakness and Rock's resistance not covering all.
- Lack of a dedicated Electric-type attacker could be problematic if facing Electric opponents.
- Maybe no strong Physical attackers besides Rock and BUG.

**Step 2: Look for Improvements**

To improve, perhaps include an Electric Pokémon to cover that gap. Also, ensure type coverage is better.

**Step 3: Scan the Roster for Strong Candidates**

Looking through the roster, I'll look for:

- High HP.
- Effective movesets.
- Good synergy with each other.

Let's consider some indices:

- **0**: Normal, Max HP 104. Good all-rouser but maybe not top in stats.
- **1**: Ghost/Normal, Max HP 135. Could be a wall with Disable and Trickroom.
- **2**: FIGHT, Max HP 160. Strong attacker, good physical moves.
- **3**: Ice/Ground, Max HP 103. Good defensive type, Ground has resistances.
- **4**: Grass, Max HP 94. Not the highest HP but good for specific roles.
- **5**: Psych/Rock, Max HP 75. Could be a wall with Rock and have some offensive moves.
- **6**: Ground/Flying, Max HP 150. High HP, strong ground moves.
- **7**: Dark/Steel, Max HP 142. Good defensive type, Steel for resistances.
- **8**: Flying, Max HP 106. Good for switching, has Dragon and Normal moves.
- **9**: Fairy, Max HP 128. Good support with Faerie moves like Trickroom.
- **10**: Electric/Fire, Max HP 116. Fire is strong, Electric adds versatility.
- **11**: Steel, Max HP 77. Not the highest HP but useful for resistances.
- **12**: Dark, Max HP 154. Strong attacker with Dark moves.
- **13**: Ghost/Electric, Max HP 106. Can handle Ghost types and have Electric support.
- **14**: Water/Psychic, Max HP 160. Already used last time; maybe not again unless necessary.

From this list, I need to pick three that complement each other, considering their types, move sets, and HP.

Given the previous team was [35,30,14], which are Bug, Rock, Water/Psychic.

So the new team should probably cover different types, perhaps avoid duplicates unless necessary, and include strong attackers or support.

Looking at the types used before: Bug (35), Rock (30), Water/Psychic (14). So to not have too much overlap, maybe pick from other types like Fire, Electric, Ground, etc.

Looking for high HP templates would be good. For example, 19 (Ground/Dragon, 160HP), 39 (Electric, 160HP), and 38 (Ghost/Normal, 160HP) are all high HP.

But considering the last battle lost, maybe we need stronger attackers. Alternatively, perhaps include a Dragon type for its strong moves.

Alternatively, if I pick higher attack power with decent HP: 20 is Fight, Max HP 125, which has strong physical attacks. Or 12 (Dark, 154HP) with good Dark moves.

Wait, but the last team had Bug, Rock, and Water/Psychic. Maybe to counter that, include types that resist or counter those types. For example, Ground resists Bug, Rock, and Water. So adding a Ground type could be useful for defense.

Looking at PkmTemplate 36: Ground, Max HP 135 with strong Ground moves and bug support. That could help in case of Bug or Rock attackers.

Also, maybe add Electric for its versatility against Water and others. Template 39 is Electric/Steel, which can handle multiple types.

And perhaps a Dragon type for strong physical attacks. Template 19: Ground/Dragon, Max HP 160 has both Ground (good for defense) and Dragon moves that are strong in combat.

Alternatively, another option could be to pick high HP templates that cover different types.

Wait, but I need exactly three indices. Let me think about the best combination.

If I take 39 (Electric/Steel, 160HP), which is a strong attacker with Electric and Steel moves. Then 36 (Ground, 135HP) for Ground defense and Bug resistance. And perhaps 19 (Ground/Dragon, 160HP) to add another Ground but with Dragon moves or maybe replace it.

Alternatively, 39 (Electric/Steel) would handle Electric and Steel types, which can counter Water and Rock. Then 36 (Ground) as a solid defender. And 38 (Ghost/Normal, 160HP), which has Ghost moves that can handle Bug and Normal, making a good support.

Another option is to take 39, 36, and 19: Electric/Steel, Ground, and Ground/Dragon. But maybe overkill on Ground.

Alternatively, 39 (Electric/Steel), 38 (Ghost/Normal), and 20 (Fight). Fight can handle multiple types with physical attacks.

But I need to see what's best for the next battle. Since the last result was a loss, perhaps adding stronger attackers would be better.

Looking at Template 12: Dark, Max HP 154. It has high HP and good Dark moves which can counter Normal and Fighting types.

Template 32: Grass/Steel, Max HP 116. Good for Grass and Steel, which can help against Water and Rock.

But maybe combining with Electric is better for versatility.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to pick three templates that together cover multiple types, provide good defense, and have strong attacks.

So possible combinations:

1. Electric/Steel (39), Ground (36), Dark (12)
2. Electric/Steel (39), Ground (36), Fight (20)
3. Electric/Steel (39), Ghost/Normal (38), Dragon/Fight (19)

I think the first combination might be too spread out, but maybe the second is better for defense.

Alternatively, perhaps 39, 36, and 14: Electric/Steel, Ground, Water/Psychic. But 14 was part of the previous team.

Wait, no, in the last result, the team lost. So to avoid repeating too much, maybe exclude 14.

Perhaps pick 39 (Electric/Steel), 36 (Ground), and 38 (Ghost/Normal). This would give Electric/Steel for versatility, Ground for defense against Bug and Water, and Ghost/Normal for handling Normal types and support.

Alternatively, 39, 36, and 12: Electric/Steel, Ground, Dark. Dark can handle Normal and Fighting, adding more coverage.

But I'm not sure which combination is best. Maybe a mix of high HP, type coverage, and good moves.

After considering, perhaps the best new team would be:

- Electric/Steel (39) for its strong Electric and Steel moves, which counter Water, Rock, and others.
- Ground (36) for defense against Bug and Water, and has strong Bug moves.
- Dark (12) for high HP and good Dark moves to counter Normal and Fighting types.

Alternatively, maybe replace Dark with another type. But considering all factors, I think 39, 36, and 12 could be a solid team.

But wait, the previous team had Bug (35), Rock (30), and Water/Psychic (14). So if I pick Electric/Steel, Ground, and Dark, it covers more defensive types.

Alternatively, maybe pick Fight (20) for its strong physical attacks. So 39 (Electric/Steel), 36 (Ground), and 20 (Fight).

This way, they can handle multiple types and have strong attackers.

I think that's a good balance.

Alright, I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their last victory and previous performance. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the input. The user provided a list of 50 Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves. They also mentioned that their last team won, and they had Elo points updated to 1139.41. Their previous team used indices [39, 36, 20]. Now, they want me to select three new indices from the given roster.

Since the user's last team was successful, I should look for Pokémon that are effective against the types their last team might have been using. However, without knowing the exact types of the previous team, this becomes a bit tricky. So, maybe I'll focus on other factors like overall power, moves that can cover multiple types, and synergy between Pokémon.

Looking at the current roster, I need to find three Pokémon that could complement each other. Each should have strong stats and versatile moves that can adapt to different battle scenarios. 

I'll start by examining the most powerful options. Index 19 has a high max HP of 160 and some strong moves like Power 119 and Fire. That seems like a solid choice for a tank or a damage dealer. Next, index 36 is a Ground type with decent stats and access to Bug and Grass moves, which can provide good versatility.

Now, I need the third Pokémon. Index 20 has Fighting moves, including Giga Impact and Dark Pulse, which are strong offensive moves. It also has good accuracy and defense, making it a well-rounded option. 

Considering their types: Ground (36) is versatile, Fighting (20) covers multiple types and can switch between them effectively, and Rock/Ground (19) provides resistance and offensive power. This combination should work well against various opponents.

I'll double-check the movesets to ensure there's no overlap that could cause issues in team composition, but it seems like a good mix. So, the final indices would be 36, 20, and 19.

Okay, so I need to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster would maximize my chances in the next battle. The previous team that won had indices [39, 36, 20], and my Elo is now 1149.38. 

First, I should probably look at what each Pokémon in the new team could bring in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Since I don't have information about the opposing team, I'll have to make some general assumptions based on their types.

Looking at the previous winning team, indices 39, 36, and 20. Let's check what those Pokémon are:

- Index 39: Type is ELECTRIC. Electric types usually have moves like Thunderbolt or Electro Ball which can be strong against Water, Ground, and some Grass types.
- Index 36: Type is GROUND. Ground types are good against Grass, Rock, and Water, but can be weak to Electric and Ice.
- Index 20: Type is FIGHT. Fighting types are usually strong against Dark, Ice, and Rock. They also have moves like Close Combat or Psycho Cut which can be powerful.

So, the last team had a mix of Electric, Ground, and Fighting types. Maybe I should stick with similar types to maintain that balance. Let's see what other types in the roster could complement each other.

Looking through the roster, there are a lot of options. Let me consider some strong Pokémon:

- Index 14: Type is WATER/PSYCHIC. Water can support Electric and Ground because Water resists Electric (except for Electro Ball or Thunder). But since I already have Ground in the previous team, maybe adding more Water isn't necessary. However, Psychic types can be useful with moves like Teleport or Hypnotic Gem.
- Index 30: Type is ROCK. Rock is good against Fire, Ice, and Dragon types. It can also support Ground types, but since I already have a Ground in the previous team, maybe adding another type that covers different weaknesses would be better.
- Index 49: Type is GRASS. Grass is strong against Water and Fire. If the opposing team has Water or Fire types, having Grass can help cover those weaknesses. Also, it's weak to Electric and Ground, but I already have both in the previous team.

Wait, maybe I should think about type coverage. The previous team had Electric, Ground, Fighting. So they covered:

- Electric vs Ground (good)
- Ground vs Water, Grass, Rock
- Fighting vs Dark, Ice, Rock

So their weaknesses might be against Fire, Psychic, and Dragon types. Therefore, the next team should cover those weaknesses.

Looking for types that can cover these:

1. Fire: Can use Fire-type Pokémon to counter Fire attacks.
2. Psychic: Use Psychic or Ghost types with moves like Teleport or Hypnotic Gem.
3. Dragon: Use Dragon or Ice types, but Ice is weak against Ground which I have already.

So perhaps adding a Grass type for coverage against Water and Fire (but wait, Grass is weak to Electric and Ground), so maybe not the best. Alternatively, adding a Psychic type would help against Fighting and Dark types, but since they already have Fighting, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the specific Pokémon in the roster that could perform well:

- Index 14: Water/Psychic. Water can resist Electric and Ground (but if opponent has Electric, it's bad for Water). Psychic can help with moves against Fighting and Dark.
- Index 30: Rock. Good against Fire, Ice, Dragon. But since I have a Fighting type which is weak to Ice, maybe adding Rock isn't necessary because the previous team already covers Ice with Fighting? Or no, because Fighting is weak to Ice, so maybe opponent has Ice types.

Wait, but in the last battle, the team had Electric, Ground, and Fighting. So if the opponent was using Fire or Water, they might have lost unless their moves were strong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for Pokémon that are strong against multiple types and have high HP and accuracy.

Looking at index 14 again: Water/Psychic. It has Heal and other supportive moves. Also, Water can be useful with Electro Ball. But maybe it's better to focus on attackers.

Wait, looking at the previous team, they used Electric (index39), Ground (36), and Fighting (20). Let me check their moves:

- Index 39: Electric. Has Thunderbolt (Power 96), Electro Ball (Accuracy 0.83). So strong against Water and Ground.
- Index 36: Ground. Has Bug Bite (Power 129), Stone Edge (Power 15), etc. Strong against Grass, Rock, Water.
- Index 20: Fighting. Has Close Combat (Power 120), Psycho Cut (Power 85), etc. Strong against Dark, Ice, Rock.

So their types covered:

- Electric vs Ground and Water
- Ground vs Grass, Rock, Water
- Fighting vs Dark, Ice, Rock

So the team was strong against those types but weak to Fire, Psychic, and Dragon.

Therefore, in the next battle, opponent might have Fire or Dragon types. So I need Pokémon that can handle those.

Looking for:

- Fire: Use Fire-type with high Power moves.
- Dragon: Use Dragon or Ice (but Ice is weak to Ground).
- Psychic: Use Psychic or Ghost to counter Fighting and Dark.

Wait, but I already have a Fighting type in the previous team. So if opponent has Psychic types, they could be problematic. So maybe adding another Electric or Ground would help, but since those are already used, perhaps adding a Fire-type to counter Fire attacks and Grass for Water.

Alternatively, looking at index 49: Grass. It's strong against Water and Fire. So if the opponent has Water or Fire, this can help. But Grass is weak to Electric and Ground, which I have, so it might not be the best.

Wait, maybe I should look for a Fire-type that also has good coverage against Ice or Dragon. Let me check index 20: Fighting, but already used. Index 3: Ice/Ground (but I have Ground). Index7: Dark/Steel. Maybe adding Steel can help with Rock and Ground, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, index14 is Water/Psychic. It could resist Electric and Ground, which are my current team's strengths. But if opponent has Fire or Dragon, this might not be enough.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to select Pokémon that have strong moves against common opponents' types. For example:

- If opponent has Water, use Electric (already used) or Rock (index30). Rock can handle Water with Stone Edge.
- If opponent has Fire, use Grass or Electric. Since I already have Electric, adding Grass could help.
- If opponent has Ice, Fighting can handle it but is weak to Ice. So maybe not the best.
- If opponent has Dragon, use Steel or Rock.

Wait, index30: Rock. It's strong against Fire and Water (with Stone Edge), and also against Ice with Ice attack? No, Rock doesn't have Ice attacks. Wait, no, Rock can be weak to Ice. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to add a Psychic type for coverage against Fighting and Dark. But since the previous team had Fighting, which is weak to Ice, maybe opponent has Ice types, so adding something that can handle Ice, like Rock or Dragon.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The previous team was Electric, Ground, Fighting. So their strengths are:

- Electric: vs Water, Ground
- Ground: vs Grass, Rock, Water
- Fighting: vs Dark, Ice, Rock

Their weaknesses would be against Fire, Psychic, and Dragon.

So to counter the next opponent's possible types (if they use Fire or Dragon), I need Pokémon that can handle those.

Looking for:

- Fire: Use Fire-type with strong moves.
- Dragon: Use Steel or Rock (since Dragon is weak to Steel) or Ice (weak to Ground).
- Psychic: Use Psychic or Ghost.

So perhaps adding a Fire-type and a Steel-type would help. Looking at the available indices:

Fire types: index0,4,8, etc. Let me check.

Index0: Normal. Not particularly strong against Fire.
Index4: Grass. Can handle Water but not Fire directly. Wait, no, Grass is weak to Fire.
Wait, maybe I need a Fire-type attacker. Looking at the available indices:

- Index20: Fighting (already used)
- Index7: Dark/Steel. No, Dark/Steel doesn't have Fire moves.
- Maybe index9: Fairy. Doesn't handle Fire well.

Alternatively, looking for Fire types in the list:

Looking at the Roster:

PkmTemplate Type= FIRE:

Index0: Normal. Not specific to Fire.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for a Fire-type that can also handle Ice or Dragon.

Wait, perhaps index20 is Fighting, which handles Ice but is weak to Ice. So if opponent has Ice types, my team is weak because Fighting is already used and Ground (index36) is also weak to Ice via moves? Wait no, Ground's weakness is Grass, Rock, Water. Wait, no, Ground is strong against Grass, Rock, Water, but not sure about Ice.

Wait, each Pokémon's Type determines their weaknesses. For example:

- Electric: Weak to Ground.
- Ground: Weak to Ice, Grass, etc. No, wait, Ground is weak to Ice? Or is it the other way around?

No, actually, in the context of Pokémon battles, each type has certain weaknesses.

For example:

- Ground is weak to Ice because Ice can freeze the ground and make moves like 'Icy Wind' or 'Blizzard' which are super effective against Ground.

Wait, no. Actually, it's the other way around: Ground is immune to Ice moves (like Blizzard) because they're on the ground. Wait, not sure. Maybe I should refer back to the move effects in the templates.

Looking at index36:

Moves include Bug Bite (Power 129), Stone Edge (Power 15, which is low but effective against Water?), etc. Not seeing Ice-related moves. So perhaps Ground isn't strong against Ice.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the move for each type.

For example:

- Electric attacks are super effective against Water and Ground.
- Ground attacks are super effective against Grass and Rock, but not sure about Ice.
- Fighting attacks are super effective against Dark and Ice.

So index20 (Fighting) can handle Ice.

Therefore, if opponent has Ice types, my current team's Fighting Pokémon (index20) is strong against them. So perhaps the weakness isn't a big issue.

Wait, but opponent could have multiple types, like Ground/Dragon or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on adding another type that covers more weaknesses.

Looking back at the previous result: last time the team won with indices [39,36,20], which are Electric (index39), Ground (36), and Fighting (20). So their types covered:

- Electric vs Water/Ground
- Ground vs Grass/Rock/Water
- Fighting vs Dark/Ice/Rock

Weaknesses against Fire, Psychic, Dragon.

So to handle the next opponent, perhaps I should add a Fire-type that can also handle some other weaknesses.

Looking for a Fire-type with strong moves:

Index0: Normal. Moves include FIRE, so it's not specifically a Fire type but has FIRE attacks.
Index8: Flying. Has DRAGON and FIRE moves? Let me check.

Wait, index8 is FLYING. Its moves include GRASS (Power 140), which is weak against Fire, but itself isn't Fire.

Alternatively, looking for a Fire-type with strong moves:

Looking through the Roster:

- Type=FAIRY: Some have FIRE moves, like index9.
- Type=DRAGON: Some have FIRE moves.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think in terms of what types would counter the opponent's team.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to select the three highest Max HP from the remaining Pokémon not used last time.

Last time, indices [39,36,20] were used. So available now are all except these.

Looking at the Roster, let me list them with their max HP:

0: 104
1:135
2:160
3:103
4:94
5:75
6:150
7:142
8:106
9:128
10:116
11:77
12:154
13:106
14:160
15:94
16:82
17:100
18:120
19:160
20:125 (used)
21:101
22:126
23:95
24:105
25:125
26:95
27:92
28:113
29:108
30:113 (used as index39? Wait, no. Index39 is a different Pokémon.

Wait, sorry, in the given data:

The indices go from 0 to 49.

Last time, the team used [20,36,39], so current available are all except these.

So, sorted by Max HP:

14:160 (used as index14? Wait no, index14 is another Pokémon. Last team was [20,36,39]. So we need to exclude those three.

Looking through each index:

0-49, excluding 20,36,39.

So the highest Max HP available would be 14:160, 19:160, 2:160, 12:154, etc.

Wait, let me list all the Max HPs in order:

Index: Max_HP
14:160
19:160
2:160
12:154
17:100
18:120
22:126
24:105
25:125
26:95
27:92
28:113
29:108
30:113 (but index30 is a different Pokémon)
31:126
32:116
33:89
34:103
35:156
37:97
38:160
39: used
40:138
41:119
42:147
43:135
44:160
45:136
46:122
47:81
48:122
49:95

Wait, so the highest Max HPs available are 14 (160),19(160),2(160). Then 12:154, etc.

So if I pick three with the highest Max HP, that would be indices 14,19,2. But let's check their types:

Index14: Type=WATER/PSYCHIC
Index19: Type=GROUND/DRAGON
Index2: Type=FIGHT

Wait, but perhaps having all three as high HP might not be the best for coverage.

Alternatively, maybe selecting based on type coverage is better.

But without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to determine. But since the last result was a win with Elo 1149, maybe the same strategy worked before.

Looking back at previous wins:

The user mentioned that in past matches, they used [20,36,39]. So their current team is probably similar but needs to be updated.

Wait, perhaps they need to select three Pokémon not used last time. But I'm not sure; the instructions just say choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster that will maximize chances next battle.

Since I don't have information about the opponent's types or weaknesses, maybe the best approach is to pick the three highest Max HP available.

So excluding indices 20,36,39:

The top Max_HP are:

14:160
19:160
2:160

Then:

12:154
44:160 (wait, index44 is Type=STEEL, Max_HP=160. But was it used before? No, only 20,36,39 were used.

Wait, no: the last team used indices [20,36,39], so current available are all except these.

So index44 has Max_HP=160 and wasn't used before, same with 2,14,19.

So picking the highest HP would be 2,14,19. But let me check their types:

Index2: Type=FIGHT
Index14: Type=WATER/PSYCHIC
Index19: Type=GROUND/DRAGON

This gives a good mix of types, covering Water, Ground, and Psychic, which could be versatile.

Alternatively, maybe selecting based on previous team's success. Since last time they used [20,36,39], which are FIGHT, GROUND, ELECTRIC. So this time maybe pick different types to cover what might have been weak against before.

But without knowing the opponent's type weaknesses, it's hard. So perhaps choosing high HP is safer.

So I think the best response would be to select indices 14,19,2: ---14, 19, 2---

Wait, but let me double-check:

Index2: Type=FIGHT
Index14: Type=WATER/PSYCHIC
Index19: Type=GROUND/DRAGON

Yes, that's a good mix. Alternatively, if I pick index44 (STEEL), which also has high HP.

But considering the previous team used FIGHT, GROUND, ELECTRIC (indices 20,36,39). So this time avoiding those types might be better. So picking WATER/PSYCHIC, GROUND/DRAGON, and FIGHT could provide good coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps pick index44 (STEEL) instead of index2 or 19 for more versatility.

Wait, but the highest HPs are all around 160, so maybe including as many as possible is better.

So possible teams:

- 14,19,2
- 14,44,2
- 19,44,2

But I need to pick three. The user might prefer a mix of types that can handle various opponents.

Alternatively, perhaps index14 (WATER/PSYCHIC), index19 (GROUND/DRAGON), and index44 (STEEL) would provide Water, Ground, Steel coverage, which are strong types.

So the team would be 14,19,44: ---14, 19, 44---

But I'm not sure if that's better than other combinations. Alternatively, picking higher HP regardless of type might be safer.

Another option is to pick the highest HP without considering types, so indices 2,14,19.

So perhaps the answer is ---2, 14, 19---.

Okay, I need to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster will maximize my chances in the next battle. My last team won, so I'm coming off a victory. The previous team used indices [39, 36, 20], and they succeeded. Now, I have to choose the next set.

First, I should recall each Pokémon's type, max HP, and moves to evaluate their strengths. Since my last battle was successful, maybe I want to maintain some of the same types or strategies, but also improve where possible.

Looking at the indices provided:

39: Type is ELECTRIC with 160 HP. Its moves include NORMAL, which is versatile, and BUG, which can be useful for status moves. It has Protect, which is great for reducing damage, and Light Screen as a Special move. Electric types are good for dealing damage to Water and Ground Pokémon.

36: This is GROUND type with 135 HP. Ground-type moves include Bug, which is good for status, Tailwind, which boosts allies' evasion, and Sand Stream, though I'm not sure if that's relevant here. It also has a high accuracy and some powerful physical moves.

20: FIGHT type with 125 HP. Fight Pokémon are known for their offensive capabilities. This one has Ground and Dark moves, which can be effective against various types, plus Protect and Tailwind to boost defense and evasion.

So my previous team had Electric, Ground, and Fight types. They covered a good range of offenses and defenses. Now, I need to pick three that are strong and complementary, possibly with different types or improved stats.

Looking through the roster again, I should consider what each Pokémon can bring:

- Type coverage: having Electric (for Water/Ground), maybe another type like Rock for versatility, and a strong attacker.

- Moves: high accuracy, powerful moves, status moves, and defensive options like Protect are important.

Let me go through each possible choice:

Starting with index 14: Type WATER/PSYCHIC. It has Normal, which is good, and Heal, which can be useful. But I might not want too many Water types since Electric is strong against them.

Index 30: ROCK type with 113 HP. Rock is great for Ground and Water Pokémon, and it has Light Screen and Protect as Special moves. High PP could help in long battles.

Index 49: GRASS type with 95 HP. Grass can be useful against Fire and Water. It has Fire move, which might not be the best if the opponent has Water or Ground, but also FLYING and other good moves.

Alternatively, index 35 is BUG with high HP (156) and strong FIGHT and TOXIC moves. That could be a powerful attacker.

Index 37: PSYCHIC type with 97 HP. It has Bug, which is good, and Protect, but I'm not sure about its overall effectiveness.

Wait, maybe I should look for types that can counter each other or have synergy. For example, Electric vs Ground, Rock, etc. Also, considering the previous team's success, perhaps sticking with similar types would be safe but also looking to add a strong attacker.

Another option is index 19: GROUND/DRAGON. Dragon type has great offensive options and can switch types effectively.

Index 26: FAIRY/DRAGON. Fairy is good against Dark and Poison, and Dragon adds powerful moves.

Hmm, perhaps combining Electric, Rock, and a strong attacker like Bug or Dragon could be beneficial.

Wait, let me think about the types:

- Electric (39) covers Water and Ground.
- Rock (30) covers Ground and Water, plus Protect and Light Screen.
- Grass (49) covers Fire, but maybe not as crucial. Alternatively, Bug (35) can cover more offensive moves.

Alternatively, considering the previous team's success, maybe adding a strong attacker with high Power. For example, index 14: Water/Psychic has Normal and Heal, which could be useful.

But I need three types that are effective together. Electric, Ground, and Rock might be too redundant, but they provide good coverage.

Alternatively, Electric (39), Rock (30), and Grass (49) would give me Electric for Water/Ground, Rock for multi-type coverage, and Grass for Fire and additional support.

Wait, index 49 is Grass with HP 95. It has Fire, which can be useful against Water, but maybe not essential if I have Electric. But it also has FLYING, which can help in aerial battles.

Alternatively, index 26: Fairy/Drake. Fairy is good against Dark and Poison, and Dragon adds strong moves. Maybe that's a good combination for versatility.

I'm torn between keeping the same types for consistency and adding something new with better stats or more effective moves.

Another angle: look at the previous team's indices [39,36,20]. They are Electric, Ground, Fight. So maybe the next team can include similar types but perhaps different Pokémon within those types that have better individual stats.

Looking at index 14: Water/Psychic has Normal and Heal, which could be useful as a support or pivot.

Index 30: Rock with higher HP (113). It might be more durable than some others.

Index 49: Grass. Good for Fire coverage, but perhaps not as essential as other types.

Alternatively, index 20 is Fight type. If I include another Fight Pokémon, it could boost the team's offensive power.

But I can only choose three, so maybe Electric (39), Rock (30), and a strong attacker like Bug (35).

Wait, index 35: Bug has high HP (156) and strong moves like FIGHT, TOXIC. It might be a good choice for taking down opponents quickly.

So perhaps 39 (Electric), 30 (Rock), and 35 (Bug). This gives me Electric for Water/Ground, Rock for multi-purpose, and Bug for status and damage.

Alternatively, 36 is Ground with high Power moves, so maybe 36 along with others.

Wait, the previous team used 39,36,20. If I stick with similar types but different Pokémon, like 36 (Ground), 30 (Rock), and perhaps 14 (Water/Psychic). But Water might not be as strong against Electric.

Alternatively, 39,35,30: Electric, Bug, Rock.

I think that would provide good coverage. Electric for Water/Ground, Bug for status and damage, and Rock for versatility.

So the indices I'm considering are 39,35,30.

But wait, let me check each Pokémon's moves:

- 39: ELECTRIC, Max HP=160. Moves include NORMAL, BUG, etc.
- 35: BUG, Max HP=156. Moves include FIGHT, TOXIC, etc.
- 30: ROCK, Max HP=113. Moves include DRAGON, WATER, etc.

Yes, this combination seems strong. Electric for support and damage against Water/Ground, Bug for status and strong physical moves, Rock for multi-type coverage and defense.

Alternatively, maybe including a Psychic type could help with mental defenses or boosts. But perhaps that's less critical than the offensive options.

I think I'll go with 39 (Electric), 35 (Bug), and 30 (Rock). These types cover a wide range of effectiveness.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team from the roster provided. The user mentioned that it's their first battle, and they don't have any prior results. So my goal is to select three Pokémon that can potentially win against whatever opponent they might face next.

First, I need to look through each of the 49 Pokémon templates and assess their strengths. Since it's the first battle, I don't have specific weaknesses or strengths against which type, so maybe I should focus on versatile types that are strong against multiple opponents or have high Max HP for survivability.

Let me start by noting some key factors: Type effectiveness, Max HP, and movesets. High Max HP is good because it means the Pokémon can survive more damage, especially if they're going to be facing stronger opponents in the future. Movesets with high accuracy and power could also help in defeating enemies effectively.

Looking through the roster:

- PkmTemplate 0: Normal type, decent HP, has moves that are spread across different types. It seems balanced.
- PkmTemplate 1: Water type, lower Max HP, but it's a pure Water type which can be useful against Grass and Fire types.
- PkmTemplate 2: Psychic with high accuracy and some strong moves, but low Max HP could be a weakness.
- PkmTemplate 3: Grass type, good at counterattacks, but might not be the best against all types.
- PkmTemplate 4: Ice type, decent moves, moderate HP.
- PkmTemplate 5: Poison, has high Power and some strong physical moves.
- PkmTemplate 6: Steel/Psychic, which is a good mix of types for versatility.
- PkmTemplate 7: Bug with high Max PP, but not sure about its effectiveness.
- PkmTemplate 8: Steel type, which is generally strong against Rock and Ground.
- PkmTemplate 9: Rock/ Flying, could be useful against many types.
- PkmTemplate 10: FLYING, good for switching and has some strong moves.
- PkmTemplate 11: Bug with high HP but maybe not the most effective type.
- PkmTemplate 12: Steel/Poison, which is a good combination of defensive and offensive types.
- PkmTemplate 13: Dragon, which can be hard to counter, but requires specific strategies.
- PkmTemplate 14: Dark/Fairy with high Max HP and strong moves across different types.
- PkmTemplate 15: Electric/Poison, which is a good mix for both offense and defense.
- PkmTemplate 16: Fairy, can be useful against Dragon and Dark types.
- PkmTemplate 17: FIGHT, has high Max HP and strong physical moves.
- PkmTemplate 18: Steel with some boosts and defensive capabilities.
- PkmTemplate 19: Normal/ICE, which is a good type for versatility.
- PkmTemplate 20: Electric/Steel, which is great for both offense and defense.
- PkmTemplate 21: FLYING, similar to others but lower Max HP.
- PkmTemplate 22: Fire/Water, could be versatile but maybe not the best.
- PkmTemplate 23: Ghost/Bug, which can be good against each other, but might not cover all bases.
- PkmTemplate 24: Fire type, solid for offensive moves but might lack in defense.
- PkmTemplate 25: Water with some ice and ground moves, decent HP.
- PkmTemplate 26: Bug with high Max PP and strong physical moves.
- PkmTemplate 27: Dragon/Normal, which can be a good mix of types.
- PkmTemplate 28: Rock type, solid against many opponents but might not be the most versatile.
- PkmTemplate 29: FLYING, higher Max HP than others, seems durable.
- PkmTemplate 30: Ice with strong physical moves and high Max HP.
- PkmTemplate 31: Fire/Fight, good offensive and defensive capabilities.
- PkmTemplate 32: Ghost/Ground, which is a good mix for defense and offense.
- PkmTemplate 33: Ice, high Max HP, good against Fire and Grass.
- PkmTemplate 34: Dragon/FLYING, can be strong but might need specific counters.
- PkmTemplate 35: Dark/Normal, versatile with some defensive moves.
- PkmTemplate 36: Normal/Grass, which is a solid mix for coverage.
- PkmTemplate 37: Ground/Normal, good for defense and versatility.
- PkmTemplate 38: Poison with strong physical and special moves.
- PkmTemplate 39: Bug/Fire, could be useful against many types but might not be the strongest.
- PkmTemplate 40: Fight/Fire, high HP and strong offensive moves.
- PkmTemplate 41: Ghost/Steel, great for defense and versatility.
- PkmTemplate 42: Dark with strong physical moves and good accuracy.
- PkmTemplate 43: Dark with a mix of defensive and offensive moves.
- PkmTemplate 44: Ice with some defensive and offensive capabilities.
- PkmTemplate 45: Dark/ICE, which is great for both defense and offense.
- PkmTemplate 46: FLYING/Steel, good mix for switching and defense.
- PkmTemplate 47: Ice/Ghost, can be strong against many types.
- PkmTemplate 48: Psychic/Steel, versatile with good offensive moves.
- PkmTemplate 49: Electric/Normal, which is a solid mix of both types.

Looking at this, I think the goal is to balance between having strong individual Pokémon and complementary types. For the first battle, maybe it's better to pick Pokémon that are strong against each other or have broad coverage.

I notice that PkmTemplate 14 (Dark/Fairy) has high Max HP and a good variety of moves, which could make it a solid choice for defense and offense. PkmTemplate 30 (Ice) also has high Max HP and strong physical moves, making it durable against many types. Lastly, PkmTemplate 49 (Electric/Normal) is a versatile combination that can handle both offensive and defensive roles.

Alternatively, considering the user's first battle, maybe choosing Pokémon with higher Max HP would be beneficial for surviving any potential attacks. So perhaps selecting indices 0, 14, and 30 as they have high Max HP and good movesets.

Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user is part of a Pokémon team-building machine for a simplified version of Pokémon. They need to choose a new team based on certain information provided each time.

First, I see that they were given a Roster of 50 Pokémon templates, each with Type, Max_HP, and Moves. Then, they have information about the Previous Team, which are three indices used last time, and Last Result, which tells them whether their last team won or lost along with an Elo score.

The goal is to choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster that will maximize their chances in the next battle. They need to return exactly three indices in a specific format without any extra text.

Given that the Last Result was that their last team lost, and now they have an Elo of 1185.00, it's clear they are trying to improve their team for the next battle. Since no prior winning data is available, I assume they don't have a baseline for comparison beyond their current performance.

Looking at the Roster, there are various types like Normal, Water, Psychic, Grass, Ice, Poison, etc., each with different Max_HP and Moves. The key here is to select three Pokémon that can complement each other in terms of types and moves to cover different weaknesses and strengths.

But wait, without knowing the specifics of what the opponent's team is or what type of battle they're facing, it's a bit tricky. However, since the task is to maximize their chances, I need to consider which Pokémon have high Max_HP and strong offensive/defensive moves.

Looking at the Roster:

- PkmTemplate 0: Normal, Max HP 160, Moves include Water, Power 51, etc.
- PkmTemplate 1: Water, Max HP 109, Ground moves
- PkmTemplate 2: Psychic, Max HP 57, Bug and Electric moves
- PkmTemplate 3: Grass, Max HP 114, Bug and Dark moves
- PkmTemplate 4: Ice, Max HP 82, Fighting and Flying moves
- And so on.

Since the previous team used indices [0,14,30], which are Normal, Dark/Fairy, and Ice types respectively. The last result was a loss, so perhaps the team wasn't strong enough in the previous matchup. Now, they need to replace or adjust their team.

But since I don't have the opponent's information, maybe the best approach is to select Pokémon with high Max_HP that can cover multiple types and have strong moves to deal with various opponents.

Looking at the Roster again, indices 0 (Normal), 14 (Dark/Fairy), 30 (Ice) were used last time. Since they lost, perhaps their team's type coverage was inadequate. To improve, maybe they should include a Water or Electric type for versatility.

Alternatively, choosing Pokémon with strong physical or special moves could help in battles.

Wait, but without knowing the exact opponent types or the battle environment (like weather or terrain effects), it's challenging to determine the optimal team. However, since the user is trying to maximize their chances, they should focus on selecting Pokémon that are generally strong offensively and have good defensive stats.

Looking at each Pokémon:

- PkmTemplate 0: Normal type with decent moves, including Water which could be useful.
- PkmTemplate 1: Water with Ground moves, which can cover multiple types.
- PkmTemplate 2: Psychic with Bug and Electric; Psychic is a good support type.
- PkmTemplate 3: Grass with Bug and Dark; versatile ground coverage.
- PkmTemplate 4: Ice with Fighting and Flying; useful for physical attacks.
- PkmTemplate 14: Dark/Fairy with Ground moves, which can be strong against many types.
- PkmTemplate 30: Ice with Fire and Rock moves, providing both offense and defense.

Given that the previous team used [0,14,30], perhaps they need to replace one or two. But since it's a new team, maybe starting fresh would be better, but the user hasn't specified any prior preferences beyond what was used last time.

Alternatively, considering high Max_HP: PkmTemplate 0 has 160 HP, which is quite high. Others like 14 (160), 30 (90), etc. So using 0 and 14 gives two strong starters.

For the third member, perhaps someone with good all-around moves. Looking at PkmTemplate 2 (Psychic) or maybe another type that covers multiple weaknesses.

Wait, but without knowing the exact opponent's team, it's difficult to choose optimally. However, since the user is trying to maximize their chances, they might prefer a team that can handle various types and has strong moves.

In this case, perhaps selecting 0 (Normal), 14 (Dark/Fairy), and another type like Electric or Water could be beneficial. Looking at PkmTemplate 1 (Water) or maybe 6 (Psychic/Steel). But the user's previous team had 30 (Ice), so maybe avoiding duplication unless necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps using 0, 14, and 2 as a mix of Normal, Dark/Fairy, and Psychic could provide good coverage. Or maybe 0, 1, and 30 for Normal, Water, and Ice.

Wait, but the user's previous team was [0,14,30], which is Normal, Dark/Fairy, Ice. They lost last time, so perhaps they need to change one or more members. But since it's a new battle, maybe starting with a fresh trio could be better.

Alternatively, considering that each type has its strengths and weaknesses, a team with coverage across different types would be beneficial. For example, having Normal (resistance to Fighting), Dark/Fairy (good against Ghosts and Bugs), and Ice (strong against Fire and Grass) could be a solid mix.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to say. However, in many Pokémon games, having a variety of types is essential. So maybe selecting 0 (Normal), 14 (Dark/Fairy), and 30 (Ice) again, but perhaps adjusting one member for better offensive moves.

Wait, but since they lost last time with this team, maybe the issue was that their moves didn't cover certain aspects. For example, if the opponent had a strong Water or Electric type, having Normal and Dark/Fairy might not be sufficient.

Alternatively, selecting a Pokémon like 2 (Psychic) which can handle Bug and Electric types, adding more versatility.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to suggest a team that includes strong, versatile types. So maybe 0 (Normal), 1 (Water), and 30 (Ice). Or 14 (Dark/Fairy), 2 (Psychic), and another type like 6 (Psychic/Steel).

But since I have to choose from the given indices, I need to pick three that likely perform well together. Given that the user's previous team had [0,14,30], maybe they should stick with similar types but perhaps adjust one for better coverage.

Alternatively, considering the move sets, perhaps selecting 1 (Water) for strong physical moves, 14 (Dark/Fairy) for coverage against Ghosts and Bugs, and 2 (Psychic) for support and Bug resistance.

But I'm not sure. This is a tough decision without knowing the specifics of what they faced last time.

Wait, looking at the previous result: "Your last team lost. Your new Elo is 1185.00." So their last team didn't perform well. Maybe their last team had types that were weak against the opponent's team.

So to improve, they might need a team with types that are strong against common opponents or have better coverage.

Looking at the available templates, perhaps selecting 0 (Normal), 14 (Dark/Fairy), and 2 (Psychic) could provide a good balance of offense and defense. Normal is versatile, Dark/Fairy covers multiple weaknesses, and Psychic adds support and bug resistance.

Alternatively, maybe 1 (Water), 14 (Dark/Fairy), and 30 (Ice). Water can be strong against Grass and Fire, Dark/Fairy covers Ghosts and Bugs, Ice is good against Fire and Grass. That might be a solid team.

But I'm not sure which combination is better. However, since the user's previous team had 0,14,30, maybe they should try a different trio to avoid any potential weaknesses they had last time.

Alternatively, perhaps selecting higher HP members first. So 0 (160), 1 (109), and 2 (57). But 2 has lower HP, which might be risky unless their moves are strong.

Wait, but the user's previous team lost, so maybe the problem was that one of their Pokémon wasn't effective against the opponent's team. So perhaps replacing a member with better coverage or stronger moves would help.

In conclusion, I think selecting 0 (Normal), 14 (Dark/Fairy), and 2 (Psychic) could be a good choice for a new team.

Alright, I need to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The user lost their last battle and has a new Elo score of 1168.71. They want a team that can maximize their chances in the next battle.

First, I should consider what makes a Pokémon effective in battles. Typically, having strong attackers, good defenses, and complementary types is beneficial. Since the previous team used indices [0, 14, 47], let me check those templates.

Looking up:
- Index 0: Type NORMAL, Max_HP=160, Moves include Water, Special, etc.
- Index 14: Type DARK/FAIRY, Max_HP=160, Moves include Grass and Electric.
- Index 47: Type ICE/GHOST, Max_HP=116, Moves include Fairy, Water, and Protect.

So the previous team had Normal, Dark/Fairy, and Ice/Ghost types. Maybe they were effective against certain opponents but might have struggled against others. The user lost last time, so perhaps their team wasn't optimally balanced.

Now, to choose a new team, I should look for Pokémon that can cover multiple types effectively, have high Max HP for durability, and strong moves for attacking and defending.

Looking through the roster:

- Index 35: Type DARK/NORMAL, Max_HP=160. This could provide both Normal and Dark types, which are versatile.
- Index 30: Type ICE, Max_HP=90. Ice is a good defensive type with moves like Reflect and Protect.
- Index 49: Type ELECTRIC/NORMAL, Max_HP=116. Electric adds versatility, especially against certain types like Ground or Water.

Let me check their moves:
- 35 has Dark and Normal moves, which can be effective against many types.
- 30's Ice type can handle Grass, Rock, and Water types, with Protect for defense.
- 49 combines Electric and Normal, which can deal good damage and have Reflect for defense.

Comparing these to the previous team:
- The new team replaces two of the previous indices (0 and 47) with more versatile types. Index 35 adds Dark/Normal, which complements their Fairy and Ghost in the old team. Index 30 adds Ice, which can be useful against Water or Grass opponents. Index 49 adds Electric Normal, which can support through moves like Reflect.

I should also consider the Max HP: 160 is high for 35, 116 for 49, and 90 for 30. They seem reasonably durable.

Moves-wise, each has strong attacks and defensive options:
- 35's Dark move set includes Power 140, which is quite strong.
- 30's Ice type has moves like Power 140 and Protect.
- 49's Electric Normal has Reflect, which can help in defense.

Considering the previous loss, maybe the team needs more consistent attackers and better defensive moves. These choices seem to address that with higher HP and useful moves.

So, the new team would be [35, 30, 49]. They offer a good mix of types, high Max HP, and strong offensive/defensive moves, which should increase their chances in the next battle.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team for this simplified version of Pokémon. The goal is to maximize my chances in the next battle based on the information provided.

First, let me understand what's given:

- **Roster:** A list of 50 Pokémon templates with their types, Max HP, and moves.
- **Previous Team:** The indices [35, 30, 49].
- **Last Result:** The team lost, with a new Elo of 1151.03.

The task is to select exactly three Pokémon from the roster (using the given indices) that can perform well in the next battle. I need to return their indices in the specified format without any extra text.

Since my last team lost, I should aim to improve or at least not do worse. But how do I know which Pokémon are better? In real Pokémon games, ELO rating systems are used where each win increases your rating and a loss decreases it. Since my Elo dropped, I need to select stronger Pokémon that can help me climb back up.

Looking at the previous team's indices [35, 30, 49], let me check what those Pokémon are:

- **Index 35:** Type is DARK/NORMAL with Max HP 160 and some moves.
- **Index 30:** Type ICE with Max HP 90.
- **Index 49:** Type ELECTRIC/NORMAL, Max HP 116.

I need to evaluate each of these and see how they performed. But since I don't have battle logs, I have to rely on the move sets and types to assess their effectiveness.

In Pokémon battles, type advantages are crucial. So, if my team has strong typings against the opponent's types, that can give me an edge. Also, moves with high power, accuracy, and PP (which is the number of uses before it becomes ineffective) are important.

Let me list out the types each previous Pokémon has:

- **35:** DARK/NORMAL
- **30:** ICE
- **49:** ELECTRIC/NORMAL

I should consider what types are strong against others. For example, Electric is good against Ice and Water.

But without knowing the opponent's type, it's tricky. However, if I can cover multiple types or have versatile Pokémon that can adapt, that might be beneficial.

Looking at each Pokémon:

**Index 35 (DARK/NORMAL):**
- Max HP: 160, which is decent.
- Moves include Dark and Normal moves. Some are powerful like Power 140 and others with accuracy around 0.81 to 1.
- Normal type can be good against Fighting, Rock, etc., while Dark is strong against Ghost, Ice, and other types.

**Index 30 (ICE):**
- Max HP: 90, which is lower than some others.
- Moves include Ice and Physical attacks. It has a Power 140 move but may not have the highest PP or accuracy compared to others.
- ICE is strong against Fire, Grass, and Rock, but can be weak against Electric and Water.

**Index 49 (ELECTRIC/NORMAL):**
- Max HP: 116.
- Moves include Electric and Normal types. Some powerful moves with high Power, like 140, and decent accuracy.
- Electric is good against Ice and Water but weak against Ground.

Now, considering all that, I need to decide which three indices will give me the best chance next time. Since my last team lost, maybe adding a Pokémon with strong defensive or offensive capabilities could help.

Looking at the other indices in the roster, there are many types and moves. For example:

- **Index 0:** Normal type with high Max HP.
- **Index 1:** Water type with Power 140.
- **Index 2:** Psychic with good moves.
- **Index 4:** Ice with decent stats.
- **Index 7:** Bug with high HP.

I should think about what types are strong and which Pokémon can cover multiple types. For instance, Electric and Ice might be good because of their coverage against each other and others.

But I also need to consider the effectiveness in battle. High Power moves are crucial for dealing damage quickly. Also, moves like Reflect or Protect can provide defensive benefits.

Another consideration is the previous team's composition. If my last team had certain types that didn't perform well, replacing them with more versatile types could help.

For example, if the opponent's type was Electric, having a Ground-type Pokémon would be disadvantageous because Electric moves do extra damage to Water and Ice but not Ground. Wait, no—Electric is strong against Ground? Actually, no, Electric attacks have 2x effectiveness against Ground types, meaning Ground resists Electric.

Wait, no: Ground resists Electric and Electric does 1.5x damage to Ground. So actually, Electric is good against Water and Ice, but not Ground.

So if the opponent's team has a Ground-type, my Electric/Normal would be at a disadvantage because Electric's moves do less damage to Ground. But if I have a Ghost or Rock type, that could help.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to tailor the team specifically.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on high HP and strong offensive moves can make the team more robust. For example, Pokémon with Max PP 12 or higher can use their moves multiple times, which is better for reliability.

Looking back at the previous team, they had indices 35 (DARK/NORMAL), 30 (ICE), and 49 (ELECTRIC/NORMAL). So types covered: Dark, Normal, Ice, Electric.

If I want to improve, maybe adding a Water or Grass type would provide good coverage against Fire or Electric types. Alternatively, adding a strong Psychic or Steel type could be useful for dealing with Ghosts and Ground.

Wait, considering that my last team lost, perhaps the team's composition was not optimal. Maybe choosing Pokémon with better move sets or higher accuracy can improve their performance.

For example:

- **Index 1:** Water with Power 140, which is very strong.
- **Index 6:** Psychic/Steel with high moves.
- **Index 12:** Steel/Poison with good moves.
- **Index 14:** Dark/Fairy with decent stats.

These indices have Pokémon that can be quite powerful. Since my previous team lost, perhaps replacing one of the weaker members could help.

Looking at the Max HP:

- Index 35: 160
- Index 30: 90
- Index 49: 116

So Index 35 and 49 are higher than 30. Replacing 30 with a Pokémon that can contribute more, perhaps a strong Water or Electric type.

Alternatively, if I keep the high HP types like 35 and 49, adding another strong type could help.

But without knowing the specific opponent's team, it's challenging to decide exactly. However, given that my last result was a loss, I might want to prioritize better offensive power or defensive capabilities.

For example, choosing Pokémon with higher Power moves or better accuracy can make the team more effective in battles.

Looking through the indices:

- **Index 1:** Water, Power 140
- **Index 6:** Psychic/Steel, Power 133 (from Moves: ELECTRIC, Power 133)
- **Index 7:** Bug, Power 119 (Moves: WATER, Power 119)
- **Index 12:** Steel/Poison, Power 136

These have high Power moves. If I can include one or two of these, the team might be stronger.

Alternatively, considering that in the previous battle, perhaps certain types were underperforming. Maybe adding a type that counters the opponent's type would help.

But since I don't know the opponent's type weakness, it's safer to choose versatile types.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon with high Max PP and strong moves. For example:

- **Index 26:** Bug, Max PP 12
- **Index 28:** Rock, Max PP 11

These can ensure that their moves are reliable in battle.

But again, without knowing the exact opponent's strengths, it's a bit of guessing.

Given all this, perhaps the best strategy is to choose the three Pokémon that have the highest Max HP, strong Power moves, and good accuracy. For example:

- Index 35: DARK/NORMAL, Max HP 160
- Index 49: ELECTRIC/NORMAL, Max HP 116
- Maybe another high HP like Index 0: Normal, Max HP 160.

Alternatively, combining high HP with strong types.

But considering that my last team had three indices [35,30,49], which are all quite strong. To improve, perhaps replacing the weakest member (Index 30) with a stronger one.

Looking at other indices, Index 1 is Water and has Power 140, which is very strong.

So perhaps choosing Indices 35, 49, and 1 would be better.

Wait, but in the previous team, they had [35,30,49]. So maybe replacing 30 with a stronger index.

Alternatively, another approach: since my last battle resulted in a loss, I should analyze what types or moves were underperforming. But without specific info, it's hard to say.

In any case, I need to pick three indices from the given list, excluding the previous ones unless necessary. Wait, no—there is no restriction on using previously used indices; it's allowed as long as the new team is optimal.

But considering that the last result was a loss, perhaps the moves or types used were not effective enough.

To maximize chances, I should pick Pokémon with strong offensive capabilities (high Power), good accuracy, and versatile types. Also, higher Max HP can help in surviving longer.

Looking through all indices:

- **Index 1:** Water, Power 140
- **Index 6:** Psychic/Steel, Power 133
- **Index 12:** Steel/Poison, Power 136
- **Index 35:** Dark/Normal, Max HP 160
- **Index 49:** Electric/Normal, Max HP 116

These seem strong. Maybe combining the highest Power and HP.

Perhaps picking Indices 1 (Water), 6 (Psychic/Steel), and 12 (Steel/Poison). But I need to ensure that their types cover different weaknesses.

Alternatively, maybe picking three Normal-type Pokémon for coverage, but given that Normal has some vulnerabilities, it's better to have a mix.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to be precise. However, to maximize my chances, I'll try to pick the top 3 in terms of Power and Max HP.

Looking at each index:

0: NORMAL, Max_HP=160, Moves include some strong moves with high PP.
1: WATER, Max_HP=109, very strong Power moves.
6: PSYCHIC/STEEL, Max_HP=133, also strong.
12: STEEL/POISON, Max_HP=147, strong Power and accuracy.

Wait, perhaps choosing 35 (Dark/Normal), 30 (Ice), and someone else. Hmm.

Alternatively, since I don't know the opponent's team, maybe it's better to have a balanced team with different types for coverage. For example:

- Dark/Normal: Good versatility
- Water: Strong offensive
- Electric/Normal: Also versatile

So perhaps 35 (Dark/Normal), 1 (Water), and 49 (Electric/Normal).

Alternatively, including Ice could be useful if the opponent has Grass or Fire types.

But considering that my last result was a loss, maybe I should adjust based on what might have caused the loss. Without specific info, it's hard to tell.

In any case, to make an educated guess, I think choosing Indices 35 (Dark/Normal), 30 (Ice), and 49 (Electric/Normal) would provide a good mix of types and strong stats.

Wait, but in the given Roster, Index 30 is Ice with Max_HP=90. Maybe replacing it with another stronger index like 1 or 6.

Alternatively, perhaps 35, 30, 49 are already strong, so maybe keeping them and adding a new one.

But I need to select exactly three indices, no more.

Given all this, I think the best approach is to pick the three highest Max_HP Pokémon with strong Power moves. Looking at the list:

- Index 0: Max HP 160
- Index 35: Max HP 160
- Index 36: Max HP 136
- Index 37: Max HP 139
- Index 38: Max HP 140

So, the top Max_HP are 0 (160), 35 (160), 37 (139), etc.

But combining different types could be better. For example, having Dark/Normal, Water, and Ice.

Alternatively, picking Dark/Normal, Electric/Normal, and a strong attacking type like Fire or Water.

Wait, but without knowing opponent's weaknesses, it's safer to have versatile types.

In the end, perhaps choosing the three with highest Max_HP and good Power moves would be optimal. So:

Indices 0 (160), 35 (160), and maybe 37 (139). But I need exactly three.

Alternatively, 0, 35, and another strong one like 1 or 6.

But given that in the previous team they used [35,30,49], perhaps adding a new one instead of replacing. Or maybe swapping out weaker indices.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster that will maximize your chances in the next battle."

So I need to pick three indices not previously used? No, no, the previous team was [35,30,49], but I can reuse them if needed.

Wait, looking back at the instructions: "Return exactly three indices (no more, no less), comma-separated. Use the format `---i1, i2, i3---`."

So I need to pick any three from the Roster, regardless of previous usage.

But perhaps considering that in the last battle they lost, and their Elo dropped, maybe they should avoid the same team structure.

Alternatively, perhaps selecting a mix of strong types.

Wait, given all this uncertainty, perhaps the best is to select the top 3 highest Max_HP with good moves. Let's look:

- Index 0: NORMAL, HP=160
- Index 35: DARK/NORMAL, HP=160
- Index 38: POISON, HP=140
- Index 37: GROUND/NORMAL, HP=139

So the top three are 0 (160), 35 (160), 37 (139).

But perhaps including a Water or Electric type would help against certain types.

Alternatively, to cover multiple weaknesses, maybe picking:

- Dark/Normal: 35
- Ice:30
- Electric/Normal:49

These have strong HP and versatile types. Alternatively, adding another type like Fire.

But without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to know what to counter.

In any case, I think the most straightforward is to pick the top three Max_HP with good stats, which are 0 (160), 35 (160), and perhaps 37 (139). So indices 0,35,37.

Wait, but let me check their moves. For example, index 0 has Normal type, which is neutral against most, but weak to Fighting, Rock, etc.

Index 35: Dark/Normal. Good moves including Reflect, Water, Power 140.

Index 30: Ice. Can handle Grass and Fire types with Freeze.

But since I need three, maybe choosing 0,35,37 or another combination.

Wait, perhaps the user expects a certain logic, like picking the same as before but replacing the lost indices. Or maybe focusing on types that were weak in the last battle.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to pick all Normal-type for coverage, but that may not be optimal because of vulnerabilities.

Given the uncertainty, I think the safest is to pick strong individuals regardless of type, so choosing high HP and good moves.

Therefore, my final choice would be indices 0 (160),35(160),37(139).

But wait, looking at the Roster:

Index 30: Ice, HP=90. Maybe not as high as others.

So perhaps better to pick higher HP like 0,35,37.

Alternatively, maybe including a Water type for its strong moves.

In any case, considering that in the last battle they lost, it's possible their team composition was inadequate against the opposing types. So perhaps this time, choosing more versatile types.

But since I don't have the exact opponent types, it's hard to adjust.

Therefore, after all this thinking, I will go with selecting indices 0,35,37 as a new team.

Okay, so I need to choose a new Pokémon team based on the information provided. Let me start by understanding what I have here.

First, the user mentioned that their last team lost, and their Elo is now 1131.92. So they're looking to improve their team for the next battle. They also provided a list of 49 Pokémon templates with various types, Max HP, and moves. The previous team used indices [0, 35, 37]. My task is to select three new indices from the Roster that can maximize their chances in the next battle.

I remember that in Pokémon battles, having a good mix of types can be really effective. Type coverage is important because it can neutralize or overpower opponents' moves. Also, considering each Pokémon's moveset, especially their effectiveness against others and their own weaknesses, is crucial.

Looking at the previous team [0, 35, 37]:
- Index 0: Normal type with decent moves.
- Index 35: Dark/Normal, which adds some versatility.
- Index 37: Ground/Normal, providing solid ground coverage.

So, they had a good balance but might be missing certain types. Maybe adding a Fire or Water type could help cover more type matchups.

Now, I need to evaluate the Roster to find Pokémon that can complement each other and provide strong coverage against various types. Let's go through some of them:

- Index 14: Dark/Fairy with decent moves.
- Index 30: Ice type, which is useful for countering Fire and Grass.
- Index 49: Electric/Normal, adding electric moves and Normal coverage.

Let me think about their types:
- Dark/Fairy (14) covers Fairy and Dark, which can be good against Ghosts and Bug types.
- Ice (30) is strong against Fire and Grass.
- Electric/Normal (49) provides Electric attacks and Normal defense.

This combination should offer a balance of offense and defense. The Fairy type can help with certain resistances, Ice counters Fire and Grass, and Electric adds another layer of attack options.

Additionally, considering their Max HP:
- 14 has 160 HP, which is decent.
- 30 has 90 HP, which is average but sufficient for a support role.
- 49 has 116 HP, which is good for a multi-type Pokémon.

Looking at movesets:
- 14 has useful Fairy and Dark moves.
- 30's Ice moves can be powerful against Fire types.
- 49 brings Electric and Normal attacks, which are versatile.

I should also check if these Pokémon have any weaknesses or immunities that might help in battle. For example, Electric is weak to Water, but since they're using Ice (which resists Fire), maybe it's manageable.

Another consideration is the previous team's loss. They need a strong team to regain their Elo. So, selecting Pokémon with high Max HP and strong movesets would be beneficial.

I think these three indices [14, 30, 49] could provide a well-rounded team that covers multiple types and has strong individual contributions.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm trying to figure out what Pokémon to choose next based on the given information. The user provided a lot of data about various Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves. They also mentioned that the last team lost, resulting in an Elo score update. My goal is to select three new Pokémon from this roster that can potentially perform well in the next battle.

First, I need to understand what factors influence a Pokémon's effectiveness in battles. Typically, in Pokémon games, type advantages are crucial. So, knowing which types are strong against others can help determine which Pokémon might be better suited for different scenarios. Additionally, moves with high power, accuracy, and PP (which affects how often they can be used) are important.

Looking at the previous team that lost, their indices were [14, 30, 49]. So, let me check what those Pokémon are:

- Index 14: Type is DARK/FAIRY. It has moves like GRASS with low accuracy and a Max PP of 7.
- Index 30: Type is ICE. Moves include FIRE with Power 140, which might be strong against Grass types.
- Index 49: Type is ELECTRIC/NORMAL. It has Ice-type moves which are strong against Grass.

The last result was a loss, so the previous team wasn't effective enough. I need to figure out why they lost and how to counter that.

Possible reasons for the loss could be:

1. **Type Coverage**: Maybe the previous team had overlapping types or didn't cover certain weaknesses.
2. **Move Efficiency**: If their moves weren't strong enough against the opponents' types, that could have been a problem.
3. **HP and PP**: If they had low HP or moves with poor PP, they might not have lasted long in battle.

Looking at the new roster, I need to pick three Pokémon that can complement each other, avoid type conflicts, and have strong moves against potential enemies.

I should consider selecting types that are currently underrepresented or have strong move sets. Let me go through some of the higher-index Pokémon:

- Index 26: Type BUG, HP 130. Moves include WATER (Power 119), which is strong against Ground.
- Index 38: Type POISON, HP 140. Has strong moves like GRASS with Power 85 and BURN.
- Index 43: Type DARK, HP 136. Moves include GHOST, TOXIC_SPIKES, which are good for status or support.

These three types (BUG, POISON, DARK) can cover a range of offensive and defensive needs. BUG can handle Ground types, POISON is good against Grass and Water, and DARK can deal with Ghosts and Burn.

Additionally, their moves have high power and accuracy, which should make them more effective in battle. I also notice that each has a move that could potentially disable opponents or induce status effects, which can be really useful.

I should cross-verify if these types are good against each other's weaknesses. For example, Bug is weak to Ground and Water, but since we have a Poison type with Ground resistance (index 38), it might help mitigate those weaknesses.

Also, considering their HP, they all have decent Max HP, which means they can take more hits before fainting, giving them an edge in prolonged battles.

In summary, selecting indices 26 (BUG), 38 (POISON), and 43 (DARK) seems like a solid choice for the next team. They cover multiple types, have strong offensive moves, and some defensive capabilities to help each other out.

Okay, I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their previous loss and the given roster. Let me start by understanding what they have.

The user's last team used indices [26, 38, 43], which are PkmTemplates with types BUG (26), POISON (38), and DARK/STEEL (43). Since the last battle resulted in a loss, I should aim to improve the team's overall performance. 

Looking at the Roster, there are many options, but I should focus on selecting Pokémon that can counter common types or have strong moves against the previous opponents. Also, considering their Max HP and move sets will be crucial for effectiveness.

First, I'll list out the types of the previous team: BUG, POISON, and DARK/STEEL. So, the opposing team might have counters for these types. Maybe adding a type that resists or is strong against them would help.

I should also consider the moves each Pokémon has. High accuracy and powerful physical or special attacks can make a big difference. Also, resistances to common statuses or abilities could be beneficial.

Let me go through each index:

- 26: BUG. Good offensive moves, but maybe not the best defensive stats. Its type is strong against DARK, FOG, etc., so it's good for that.
- 38: POISON. Good against GROUND and other types, has good accuracy and resistances.
- 43: DARK/STEEL. This could be a strong attacker with moves like TOXIC SPIKES and Target Boosts.

Now, I need to find replacements that can complement or improve over these. Let's see:

Looking for high HP to survive longer. Maybe types that are good against the previous team's types. For example, GHOST is strong against POISON, so adding a GHOST type could be useful.

Also, considering moves like Protect and Reflect for better defense. Some Pokémon have these which can make the team more durable.

Looking at the roster again, maybe index 30: ICE. It has high Max HP and good defensive moves like Protect and Reflect, as well as some strong physical attacks. That could be a solid choice to bolster the team's defense and offense.

Another option is 49: ELECTRIC/NORMAL. Electric can deal with GROUND types, and Normal has good versatility. This Pokémon also has moves like Tailwind which boosts attack, which could be beneficial.

Alternatively, index 12: STEEL/POISON. Steel resists a lot of attacks, and Poison can handle Ground and other types. It might complement the existing team well.

Wait, but the user lost last time with specific indices. Maybe they need to switch up their team composition. If their previous team had certain weaknesses, addressing those would help. For example, if their last team couldn't handle certain statuses or moves, choosing Pokémon with resistances or counters for that would be better.

Also, considering the last result: Elo dropped to 1089.27, so they need a stronger team. Maybe adding more supportive Pokémon like Protectors or Healers could help keep the team alive longer.

Looking at index 30 again: ICE has both Protect and Reflect, which are great for defense. Plus, it can attack with high power. That seems like a strong choice to add to the team.

Another thought: maybe adding a FLYING type for coverage and mobility. Some FLYING Pokémon have good moves like Tailwind or Protect that could be useful.

But considering the previous team's types, perhaps switching one of them for a more synergistic Pokémon would help. For example, replacing a POISON with a GHOST could better handle certain statuses and provide resistances.

Wait, but I need to choose three indices again. So maybe replacing 26 (BUG) with a stronger type, keeping POISON and DARK/STEEL. Or maybe replacing the POISON with something else.

Alternatively, if their last battle was against a Water team, adding an Electric type would be great because it's strong against Water. Looking at index 49: ELECTRIC/NORMAL, that could be a good addition as Electric is strong against Water and Normal is versatile.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact matchups of the previous battle. Since I don't have that info, I have to make an educated guess based on their types.

In any case, considering all these factors, the best new team would likely include high HP, good defensive moves, and types that can handle common threats or boost offensive capabilities.

To maximize your chances in the next battle, you should choose a team with strong defensive and offensive capabilities. Based on the given Roster and your previous loss, here's the optimal team:

---30, 26, 49---

Explanation:
- **Index 30**: This Pokémon has high Max HP, useful defensive moves like Protect and Reflect, and strong physical attacks.
- **Index 26**: A BUG type with powerful moves that can handle common threats in the battlefield.
- **Index 49**: An ELECTRIC/NORMAL type that provides versatility, with Electric moves strong against Water types and Normal moves offering solid utility.

This combination balances offense, defense, and type coverage to improve your Elo rating and give you a better chance of winning.

Alright, so I just lost a battle in this Pokémon-style game and I need to figure out a new team from the given roster. The goal is to maximize my chances next time. Let me break down what I know.

First, the previous team was [30, 26, 49]. But since it's a simplified version, I don't have the exact types or moves of each Pokémon. However, I can look up their types based on their indices. 

Looking at index 30: Type is ICE.
Index 26: Type is BUG.
Index 49: Type is ELECTRIC/NORMAL.

Hmm, so last time I had Ice, Bug, and Electric/Normal. Maybe that combination worked against the previous opponent, but since it lost, perhaps the types weren't effective or the team wasn't strong enough.

Now, to choose a new team, I should consider what types are strong against each other or have good coverage. Also, considering the last result was a loss, maybe adding more offensive or defensive Pokémon would help.

Let me go through the roster and pick three that might complement each other:

Looking for types that can cover multiple weaknesses. Let's see:

- Type effectiveness is crucial. For example, Bug beats Grass and Psychic.
- Electric is good against Ice and Water.
- Normal is versatile but can be beaten by Fighting and Rock.

Wait, maybe I should look for a balance of offense, defense, and type coverage.

Looking at the available indices:

- 0: Normal
- 1: Water
- 2: Psychic
- 3: Grass
- 4: Ice
- 5: Poison
- 6: Psychic/Steel
- 7: Bug
- 8: Steel
- 9: Rock/Flying
- 10: Flying
- 11: Bug
- 12: Steel/Poison
- 13: Dragon
- 14: Dark/Fairy
- 15: Electric/Poison
- 16: Fairy
- 17: FIGHT
- 18: Steel
- 19: Normal
- 20: Electric/Steel
- 21: Flying
- 22: Fire/Water
- 23: Ghost/Bug
- 24: Fire
- 25: Water
- 26: Bug
- 27: Dragon/Normal
- 28: Rock
- 29: Flying
- 30: Ice
- 31: Fire/Fight
- 32: Ghost/Ground
- 33: Ice
- 34: Dragon/Flying
- 35: Dark/Normal
- 36: Normal/Grass
- 37: Ground/Normal
- 38: Poison
- 39: Bug/Fire
- 40: FIGHT/Fire
- 41: Ghost/Steel
- 42: Dark
- 43: Dark
- 44: Ice
- 45: Dark/Ice
- 46: Flying/Steel
- 47: Ice/Ghost
- 48: Psychic/Steel
- 49: Electric/Normal

From this, I need to pick three that can cover multiple types and have strong moves.

Let me think about type coverage:

- Having a Water type could be good because it's versatile and might counter Grass or Fire.
- A Psychic type is good against Bug and Fighting.
- A Steel type is strong against Rock and Ice.
- Or maybe a Dragon, which is strong against Fairy and Normal.

Alternatively, considering the previous team had Ice, Bug, Electric/Normal. Maybe I should avoid types that are too similar unless they're stronger.

Looking for synergy:

- Electric and Water can cover each other's weaknesses (Electric beats Water? Wait, no, Electric is weak to Ground, so maybe not.)
- Maybe a combination of Fire, Water, and Grass would be balanced.
- Or perhaps a mix of Psychic, Steel, and something else.

Wait, considering the last battle probably involved certain types that were strong against each other, but since I lost, maybe my team's types weren't effective. So I need to choose types that are strong against what I might face next.

But without knowing the exact opponent, it's tricky. However, I can assume common type matchups.

Let me try picking:

- 26: Bug (good against Grass and Psychic)
- 44: Ice (covers Ice and Water)
- 49: Electric/Normal (can cover Electric and Normal)

Wait, but that might be too many Electric types. Maybe better to have a mix of different types.

Alternatively:

- 6: Psychic/Steel (covers Steel and Psychic)
- 32: Ghost/Ground (covers Ground and Ghost)
- 44: Ice

That gives me Psychic/Steel, Ghost/Ground, and Ice. This could cover multiple type weaknesses and provide good defensive coverage.

But I'm not sure if that's the best combination. Maybe I should look for higher HP or stronger moves.

Alternatively, let's consider indices:

- 30: Ice
- 26: Bug
- 49: Electric/Normal

These were part of my previous team but it lost. Maybe replacing one with a stronger type.

Looking at index 44: Ice (same as 30), maybe better stats or moves.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a Dragon type which is strong against Fairy and Normal.

Index 13: Dragon
Index 6: Psychic/Steel
Index 32: Ghost/Ground

This combination could be powerful with Dragon's Super Effective over Fairy and Normal, Psychic/Steel covering Steel and Psychic, and Ghost/Ground for good defensive moves.

Alternatively, maybe a more offensive team:

- 11: Bug (powerful moves)
- 14: Dark/Fairy (good against Grass and Fairy)
- 49: Electric/Normal

This could provide strong coverage with Bug handling Grass and Psychic, Dark/Fairy dealing with multiple types, and Electric/Normal for support.

I think I need to balance offense, defense, and type coverage. Maybe:

- 6: Psychic/Steel (covers Steel and Psychic)
- 30: Ice (covers Ice and Water)
- 44: Ice again? Or maybe a different type.

Wait, no duplicates allowed. So perhaps:

- 6: Psychic/Steel
- 32: Ghost/Ground
- 49: Electric/Normal

This gives me three distinct types with good coverage.

Alternatively, considering the previous team was Ice, Bug, Electric/Normal, maybe I can replace one with a stronger type like Dragon or Dark/Fairy.

But without knowing the exact opponent's type, it's hard to adjust. So perhaps sticking to a balanced team is safer.

I think I'll go with indices 6, 30, 44 as my new team.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to choose the best Pokémon team from the given roster after my last team lost. The goal is to maximize my chances in the next battle. Let me break down what I know and how I can approach this.

First, the problem statement says that before each call, I receive three pieces of information: Roster, Previous Team, and Last Result. In this case, the Last Result tells me that my previous team lost, and my new Elo is 1041.09. The task is to pick a new team from the provided roster using exactly three indices.

The Roster includes 49 Pokémon templates with various types, Max_HP, and Moves. Each index corresponds to one of these templates. My previous team used indices [6, 30, 44], which I need to avoid this time since I'm supposed to select a new team without reusing the same indices unless it's necessary. However, in the example response, they didn't mention avoiding the previous indices specifically, so maybe it's allowed to reuse them if they're strong.

Wait, actually, looking back, the instructions say to "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster," but there's no explicit rule about not reusing previous indices. So I think it's okay to include some of them if they are still strong. But perhaps using different types could be better for coverage.

Looking at the Last Result, since my last team lost, I need to improve. The Elo is 1041.09, which might indicate that my team wasn't strong enough before. So I should focus on selecting Pokémon that can cover multiple types effectively and have strong moves to overcome possible weaknesses or exploit the opponents'.

Now, let me look at each of the given templates:

Index 6: Type is PSYCHIC/STEEL, Max_HP=133
Moves include ROCK (physical), ELECTRIC (physical), WATER (special), etc. It has some good physical moves and special moves that can cover multiple types.

Index 30: Type ICE, Max_HP=90
Moves: FIRE (physical), ROCK (physical), FAIRY (special), GHOST (special). This looks like a solid ice-type with good coverage for both physical and special attacks. The Power is decent, and it has Protect, which is useful in protecting against various moves.

Index 44: Type ICE/POISON, Max_HP=95
Moves include FAIRY (special), WATER (special), POISON (physical/special). This seems like a good mix of types with some strong special moves. However, the Max HP is lower than index 30's.

Since I need to maximize chances, maybe having a combination of types that can cover multiple weaknesses would be better. Ice-type Pokémon are usually strong against Grass and Fire, but weak against Rock and Electric. So perhaps adding a Rock-type or Electric-type could help counter those weaknesses.

Looking at the available indices, let's see:

- Index 6 (PSYCHIC/STEEL): Good for both physical and special attacks, can handle various types.
- Index 30 (ICE): Strong ice-type with Protect, good for defense.
- Index 44 (ICE/POISON): Adds Poison to the mix, which is another useful type.

Wait, but I can't use all three again if they were part of my previous team. The user didn't specify that indices should be unique unless necessary. So maybe it's okay to include some if they're still effective.

Alternatively, perhaps there are other indices with stronger stats or better coverage. Let me look for Pokémon with higher Max_HP or strong moves.

For example, index 14 is DARK/FAIRY, which can be useful against Grass and Fire, but without seeing the moves, it's hard to say.

Another option is index 35 (NORMAL/GRASS): Normal covers Fighting and Rock, Grass covers Water and Fire. But I'm not sure about their specific moves.

Alternatively, maybe using a Ghost-type could help with resistances. Looking at indices like 7 or 17 for Ground/Fight, but those might be weaker.

Wait, perhaps index 28 (ROCK) is strong against Ice and Electric, which would counter the weaknesses of an Ice team. But I'm not sure if that's better than having a supportive Pokémon with Protect.

Another thought: using a Steel-type can help with both physical and special defense. Index 6 is PSYCHIC/STEEL, so it has Steel moves which are good for defense.

So maybe combining:

- A strong Ice-type (index 30) with Protect to boost team defenses.
- A Steel/Psychic type (index 6) for both physical and special defense.
- An additional type that can cover multiple types, like Poison (index 44), which also boosts my team's effectiveness against Grass and Water.

Alternatively, if I go for a more balanced approach, maybe choosing different types. But given the previous loss, perhaps adding more support like Protect is better.

Another consideration is the moves' accuracy and power. For example, index 30 has Power 140 on Ground move, which is strong.

In conclusion, after considering type coverage, defense, and move strengths, I think selecting indices 6, 30, and 44 would provide a well-rounded team with good defensive capabilities and offensive moves to handle various types.

Okay, so I need to figure out a new Pokémon team based on the given Roster and previous indices [6, 30, 44]. The user's last battle resulted in a loss with an Elo of 1015.24, so they're looking for a strong team to improve their chances.

First, I should review each of the templates from indices 6, 30, and 44 to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Then, analyze which Pokémon would complement each other, considering type coverage, move sets, and overall effectiveness in battle.

Index 6 is Type PSYCHIC/STEEL with a Max HP of 133. Its moves include Rock, Electric, Water, etc. This seems like a solid attacker with good versatility.
Index 30 is Type ICE with Max HP 90. It has moves like Ice, Fire, and Ground, which can be useful for coverage against various types.
Index 44 is Type ICE as well but with different moves, including Fairy and some special attacks.

Wait, maybe I should look at the types first. The previous team had indices 6 (PSYCHIC/STEEL), 30 (ICE), and 44 (ICE). That's two Ice types and one Steel/Psychic. Perhaps adding a strong support type would help. But since they lost last time, maybe their coverage was lacking.

Looking at the Roster, I should find other templates that can cover different types or provide boosts. For example, Ground covers resistances against Earth moves, Electric for parity, Rock for physical attacks, etc.

I notice there's a PkmTemplate at index 14 which is Type DARK/FAIRY. This type could provide good coverage with moves like Dark and Fairy, which can deal with different opponents effectively. It also has Max HP 160, which is quite high, so it can survive longer in battles.

Another option might be index 35: Type DARK/NORMAL. It has a Normal type move set that's strong against Fighting types, and Dark provides good coverage against Ghosts and Organics. This could complement the existing team well.

Wait, but since the user lost last time, maybe adding a Wall or a Tank would help. For example, index 30 is already an Ice type with decent defenses. Maybe another Ice type can provide more support, like index 44 which also has some protective moves.

Alternatively, looking at the types that are underrepresented in the previous team: they had Ice and Steel/Psychic. Adding a Ground or Rock type would give better coverage against Grass and Water types, which many Pokémon have access to.

I should also consider the move sets of each template. For example, index 14 has moves like Dark and Fairy, which can take out common opponents like Ghosts and Bug types effectively.

Perhaps replacing one of the Ice types with a more versatile type would be better. Let me check the Roster again for strong templates not yet considered.

Looking at index 30: Type ICE, Max HP 90. It has moves that cover Fire, Ground, Rock, etc., which is good for versatility. Index 44: Type ICE, Max HP 95. It also has Fairy and some other useful moves.

I think the previous team might have had trouble with certain types last time, so perhaps adding a Ghost type or another Electric type could help. But in the Roster, there are several strong options available.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the effectiveness of each Pokémon's move set against others. For instance, if the new team includes a Ghost type, it can resist Ghost moves and handle Psychic attacks effectively.

Alternatively, an Electric type would provide resistance to Electric moves and boost attack or special defense. But looking at the Roster, there are several Electric types available.

Hmm, perhaps I should pick indices that cover multiple types: Ice for versatility, Dark/FAIRY for offense and coverage, and another strong attacker.

So, considering all this, maybe a new team with indices 14 (DARK/FAIRY), 30 (ICE), and 44 (ICE) would be effective. Or perhaps replacing one of the ICEs with a stronger type.

Wait, index 6 is PSYCHIC/STEEL, which could work well alongside Dark/Fairy for good coverage. But the previous team had 6, 30, 44. Maybe replacing 6 or 44 with another strong type would be better.

Alternatively, choosing an Electric type like index 26 (BUG) could provide good support. But I need to make sure it's not already in the team.

Wait, no, the user wants three new indices, so I can't include duplicates. So perhaps selecting a mix of types that cover multiple weaknesses.

After considering all factors, I think the best choice would be to select indices 14 (DARK/FAIRY), 30 (ICE), and 44 (ICE). This gives a good balance of offense, defense, and type coverage.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best Pokémon team to choose for the next battle based on the given information. The user mentioned that this is their first battle, so there's no prior result to consider. My goal is to maximize my chances of winning by selecting three Pokémon from the roster provided.

First, I need to understand what each Pokémon's type is and how it might benefit me in a battle. Each Pokémon has different moves with types like Rock, Ground, Fire, Water, etc., which can be effective against others. Also, each move has certain accuracy, power, and other effects that could help or hinder the team.

Since this is my first battle, I don't have any data on previous wins or losses, so I need to make decisions based purely on the strengths of the Pokémon available. I should look for Pokémon that are strong in terms of their types and moves, especially those that can take down the opponent's types effectively.

Looking at the roster, there are many options, so I'll try to narrow it down by selecting Pokémon with strong offensive moves and good defensive stats. High Max HP is always a plus because it means they can survive more turns in battle.

Starting with Type coverage: Rock, Ground, Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Ice, etc., all have their strengths against each other. For example, Rock is strong against Ice and Water, while Water is good against Fire and Grass. Ground is effective against Flying and Ice. Fire can be useful against Water and Grass.

I should also consider moves with high power or accuracy because they can take down opponents quickly or prevent them from attacking effectively. Moves that cause status effects like Paralyze, Sleep, or Freeze could give me a strategic advantage.

Looking through the roster:

- PkmTemplate 0: Rock type with Ice and Grass moves. It's strong against Water and Ice but weak against Fire and Rock.
- PkmTemplate 1: Ground/Dark type. Dark is good against Bulbas and Gengar, I think. Moves include Ice, which is good against Rock.
- PkmTemplate 2: Ground/Fire. Good against Water and Air moves, maybe. Also has Electric, which is neutral but useful for some types.
- PkmTemplate 3: Bug type. Can be strong against Grass and Fire types.
- PkmTemplate 4: Ice/Psychic. Useful for counterattacks, especially against Psychic or Steel types.
- PkmTemplate 5: Steel type with moves that can reflect, which is good defensively.
- PkmTemplate 6: Rock/Ice. Good against Water and Ice, similar to others.
- PkmTemplate7: Flying/Fairy. Fairy is strong against Dark, so maybe useful for counters.
- PkmTemplate8: Dark/Ice. Ice is strong against Water and Rock, Dark against Bulbas.
- PkmTemplate9: Fire/Flying. Fire is good against Water and Grass, Flying can help with evasion.
- PkmTemplate10: Grass type. Good against Fire and Water, but weak to Ice and Electric.
- PkmTemplate11: Normal/Steel. Steel resists Rock and Ice; Normal can be useful for status moves.
- PkmTemplate12: Bug type, similar to 3.
- PkmTemplate13: Fight type. Has Rock, which is strong against Ice and Water.
- PkmTemplate14: Ground/Electric. Electric is good against Water and Air types. Ground as before.
- PkmTemplate15: Steel/Dark. Steel's moves can be useful against Rock and Ice.
- PkmTemplate16: Fairy type. Good against Dark, so useful for counters.
- PkmTemplate17: Ground/Water. Water is strong against Fire and Grass; Ground as before.
- PkmTemplate18: Poison type. Can have good moves like Ice, which is strong against Rock.
- PkmTemplate19: Fight type with Ghost moves. Ghost resists Fighting and can be used to confuse opponents.
- PkmTemplate20: Rock type, similar to 0.
- PkmTemplate21: Electric/Ground. Ground again, plus Electric for Water.
- PkmTemplate22: Electric type. Good against Water and Air, but might struggle against Fire.
- PkmTemplate23: Grass/Fire. Combines two strong types, useful for coverage.
- PkmTemplate24: Water type. Strong against Fire and Grass; good with moves that cause status.
- PkmTemplate25: Electric type. Similar to 22, maybe better stats.
- PkmTemplate26: Fight type, similar to others but with Bug moves.
- PkmTemplate27: Fight type with Electric and Ice moves. That's interesting because it can handle multiple types.
- PkmTemplate28: Poison type, similar to 18.
- PkmTemplate29: Water type with strong moves.
- PkmTemplate30: Dragon/bug. Dragon is usually strong against Ice and Steel; Bug as before.
- PkmTemplate31: Steel/Grass. Steel's good for Rock and Ice, Grass for Fire and Water.
- PkmTemplate32: Fire/Ground. Ground again, Fire for Water and Grass.
- PkmTemplate33: Grass/Fire, similar to 23.
- PkmTemplate34: Water/Steel. Steel against Rock and Ice; Water as usual.
- PkmTemplate35: Fairy type, similar to others.
- PkmTemplate36: Ghost type. Useful for status moves like Hypnosis.
- PkmTemplate37: Ground type with Grass move. Good against Fire and Water.
- PkmTemplate38: Dark/Normal. Normal is good for status, Dark as usual.
- PkmTemplate39: Fire type with Dragon moves. Fire is strong against Water and Grass; Dragon adds more versatility.
- PkmTemplate40: Ground type, similar to others but with Ice move. Good against Rock and Water.
- PkmTemplate41: Ground type with Psychic move. Good for status or counters.
- PkmTemplate42: Fairy type, similar to others.
- PkmTemplate43: Poison type with Electric moves. Can handle multiple types.
- PkmTemplate44: Grass type, similar to 10.
- PkmTemplate45: Fairy type, similar to others.
- PkmTemplate46: Dragon/POISON. Dragon is useful against Ice and Steel; Poison can be strong with moves like Ice.
- PkmTemplate47: Ice type. Strong against Fire, Rock, Water.
- PkmTemplate48: Dragon type. Similar to 30.
- PkmTemplate49: Ice/Dark. Ice as usual; Dark for counters.

Now, considering that I need three Pokémon, I should look for types that cover multiple weaknesses and have strong moves.

Looking at the available types, maybe a Rock, Ground, and Water type would be good because Rock can handle Ice and Water, Ground handles Fire and Air, and Water takes care of Fire and Grass. Alternatively, a Steel type could provide resistance against many types, but I don't know if it's necessary.

Wait, but without knowing the opponent's types in advance, I have to choose based on general strengths. So maybe a versatile team with Rock (good against Water), Ground (against Fire and Air), and Ice (against Rock and Water). Or perhaps a mix of Fire, Water, and Grass for coverage.

Alternatively, considering that some Pokémon have moves that can cause status effects like Paralyze or Sleep, which can significantly weaken the opponent's team. For example, PkmTemplate 1 has moves like Disable, which is good for controlling opponents. But I'm not sure how effective that is in this simplified version.

Looking at Max HP and PP: higher HP is better because it allows Pokémon to survive longer in battle. So I should prioritize Pokémon with high Max_HP.

Looking through the list:

- 37: Ground type, Max_HP=149, good
- 40: Ground, Max_HP=160
- 24: Water, Max_HP=160
- 39: Fire, Max_HP=153
- 29: Water, Max_HP=142
- 0: Rock, Max_HP=137
- 14: Ground/Electric, Max_HP=135

So high HP is with indices 37 (149), 40 (160), 24 (160), etc.

But I also need to consider their moves. For example, if they have strong attacking moves or status-inducing moves.

Wait, but without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to know what will be effective. But perhaps choosing Pokémon with versatile types and good coverage.

Maybe a team of Rock (0), Ground/Dark (1), and Water/Steel (24). These three cover multiple types: Rock can take Ice and Water; Ground can handle Fire and Air; Water can counter Fire and Grass.

Alternatively, a Dragon type (30 or 48) could be useful for handling Ice and Steel. But I'm not sure if that's better than Rock and Ground.

Another approach is to have a mix of types that cover different weaknesses: Rock (for Ice and Water), Electric/Ground (Ground for Fire/Air, Electric for Water), and Dragon (for Ice/Steel). But without knowing opponent types, it's difficult.

Wait, but perhaps the best strategy is to choose the three highest HP Pokémon with good stats. For example:

- 37: Ground, 149 HP
- 40: Ground, 160 HP
- 24: Water, 160 HP

These are all high HP and cover different types (Ground can take Fire/Air; Water handles Fire/Grass). Plus, they might have strong moves.

Alternatively, maybe 37, 24, and 0. Rock (0) for Ice/Water, Ground (37) for Fire/Air, and Water (24) for Fire/Grass.

But I also need to consider their moves' effectiveness. For example, PkmTemplate 37 has moves like Grass, which is good against Fire and Water. PkmTemplate 24 has FIGHT move with Power 120, which can be strong in battle.

Wait, but without knowing the exact opponent types, it's tricky. However, since this is a new battle (first time), maybe starting with a balanced team that can handle multiple types would be best.

Another thought: having at least one Pokémon that can cause status effects or has high accuracy/Power could help in quickly weakening opponents.

Looking through the moves:

- PkmTemplate 1: Has Disable, which is good for controlling opponents.
- PkmTemplate 40: Tailwind and Ice move. Tailwind boosts allies' attack/evasion, but I don't know if that's helpful here.
- PkmTemplate 37: Has Heal 0.40, which might not be as useful unless the opponent has status moves.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing a team with high HP, good attacking stats, and versatile types would be best. For example:

- 24: Water (high HP), good at handling Fire/Grass.
- 37: Ground (high HP), good for Fire/Air.
- 0: Rock, good against Ice and Water.

This way, they can cover a range of types. Plus, they have decent moves, like PkmTemplate 24's FIGHT move with Power 120.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's better than other options. For example, PkmTemplate 14 is Ground/Electric, Max_HP=135. It has moves like FLYING and DRAGON, which might be useful.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing the three highest HP Pokémon regardless of type would be the best since higher HP means more survivability.

Looking at the list:

The top HP are:

- 24:160
- 40:160
- 37:149
- 29:142

So choosing 24, 40, and 37. But that's three, which is what we need.

But wait, no, because the user said "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster". So maybe including 24 (Water), 40 (Ground), and 0 (Rock). Or 24, 40, and 37. But I'm not sure which is better.

Alternatively, maybe PkmTemplate 14: Ground/Electric, Max_HP=135. It has DRAGON move, which could be useful against Ice types.

Wait, but without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to say. However, since this is the first battle, perhaps starting with a strong, versatile team is better.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon with high PP and good attacking moves. For example, PkmTemplate 1 has ICE move with Power 140, which could be strong against Ice types. But again, without knowing opponents, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing the three highest HP Pokémon regardless of type would maximize their chances in case any type is weak against something.

But I think a more strategic approach would be better. For example, including a Rock type (0) to handle Ice and Water; Ground/Dark (1) for Fire/Air; and Water/Steel (24) for Fire/Grass.

Alternatively, perhaps 0 (Rock), 14 (Ground/Electric), and 37 (Ground). But that would have two Ground types, which might be redundant unless the opponent has a lot of Air/Fire types.

Wait, but in this simplified version, maybe having multiple types is better. For example, Rock, Ground/Dark, and Water/Steel.

So perhaps:

- 0: Rock
- 1: Ground/Dark
- 24: Water/Steel

These would cover a range of types.

Alternatively, looking at the move sets, PkmTemplate 0 has moves like ICE, which is good against Ice types. But since it's Rock, it can also handle Ice and Water.

PkmTemplate 1 has Disable, which could be useful in controlling opponents, but I'm not sure if that's better than just attacking.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the best team is 0 (Rock), 14 (Ground/Electric), and 37 (Ground). But again, two Grounds might not be necessary unless the opponent has a lot of Air/Fire.

Wait, but PkmTemplate 14 is Ground/Electric. So it can handle both Ground and Electric types, which may provide some versatility.

But I think without knowing the opponent's team composition, it's challenging to choose optimally. However, given that this is a first battle, perhaps starting with a balanced team that covers multiple types would be best.

So, considering all of this, I'll go with choosing the three highest HP Pokémon with good type coverage.

Looking back at the Max_HP:

- 24:160
- 40:160
- 37:149
- 29:142

So selecting 24, 40, and 37 as indices. But wait, the user's example includes three indices like ---14, 30, 49---.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider which types are strong against others. For example, Rock is weak against Ice; Ground is weak against Electric; Water is weak against Fire and Grass.

So a team with Rock, Ground/Dark, and Water/Steel would have coverage against each other's weaknesses.

But in the Roster, PkmTemplate 0 is Rock, 1 is Ground/Dark, and 24 is Water/Steel. So their indices are 0,1,24. But I think that might be a good team.

Alternatively, PkmTemplate 14 is Ground/Electric, which could handle both Ground and Electric types.

But the highest HP for Ground is 37 (PkmTemplate 37: Ground, Max_HP=149). So perhaps including 37 as well.

Wait, but the user's example was ---14,30,49---. So maybe I should look at how other teams are structured.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to focus on the types that can cover multiple weaknesses.

But honestly, without more information about the opponent's team, it's hard to know for sure. However, considering the last result is "This is your first battle; no prior result", the user needs a strong starting team.

Looking at the Roster, PkmTemplate 0 (Rock) has high Max_HP=137 and some strong moves like ICE, which can take down Ice types. PkmTemplate 1 (Ground/Dark) has Disable and DRAGON move, which could be versatile. PkmTemplate 14 (Ground/Electric) is another Ground type with Electric, which might have some resistances.

Alternatively, perhaps selecting 0,14,24 as their indices would give coverage across Rock, Ground/Electric, and Water/Steel.

But I'm not sure if that's the best option. Alternatively, maybe selecting higher HP like 24 (160), 40 (Ground 160), and 37 (149). So indices 24,40,37.

Wait, but the user wants a team that maximizes chances. So perhaps having high HP is better regardless of type because it can survive longer in battles.

So, considering that, the top three by Max_HP are 24,40,37. So their indices would be 24,40,37.

But I need to confirm if these are indeed the highest:

Looking through all templates, yes, PkmTemplate 24 (160), 40 (160), and 37 (149) have the highest HP.

So perhaps choosing them would be the best strategy. So their indices are 24,40,37.

Wait, but in the example, it was ---14,30,49---. Maybe the user is following a different logic.

Alternatively, considering that in the first battle, type coverage is essential, so maybe selecting types that can handle various threats.

But without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to know which types are better. So perhaps choosing a mix of high HP and good types is the way to go.

In conclusion, I think selecting PkmTemplate 0 (Rock), 1 (Ground/Dark), and 14 (Ground/Electric) might provide good coverage. But their Max_HP isn't as high as 24,40,37.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to choose the highest HP regardless of type, so 24,40,37.

But I need to make sure that these are indeed the top three. Yes:

- PkmTemplate 24:160
- PkmTemplate 40:160
- PkmTemplate 37:149

So their indices would be 24,40,37.

Wait, but in the user's example, they used ---14,30,49---, which are not necessarily the highest HP. So perhaps there's another consideration, like team synergy or move coverage.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to avoid certain types or focus on specific strengths.

But without more info, I think choosing the three highest HP is logical for maximizing chances in a new battle.

Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to help someone build a Pokémon team based on some given data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the user provided a list of Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves. They also mentioned that their last team lost, which means I should aim to improve this time around. The previous team used indices [24, 40, 37], so those are off the table for now.

The goal is to choose three new Pokémon from the roster to maximize chances in the next battle. Each Pokémon has specific moves and types, so I need to consider how they can complement each other and counter the previous team's weaknesses.

Let me start by looking at what types were used in the last team. The indices 24, 40, and 37 correspond to:

- Index 24: Type WATER
- Index 40: Type GROUND
- Index 37: Type GROUND/DARK

So the previous team had two Ground types and one Water type. Ground covers moves like Rock, Dark, etc., which are good for physical attacks and defense. Water can cover Ice or other water-based moves.

Since their team lost, I should think about what types might be weak against or counter effective against the previous opponents' types. Without knowing the exact opposing team, it's a bit tricky, but generally, having a diverse team with types that can cover each other's weaknesses is ideal.

Looking at the roster, I need to find three Pokémon that can support each other and maybe have moves that can take down common types or have strong defensive traits.

Let me consider some strategies:

1. **Type Coverage**: Maybe include a Rock type for defense against Ground, a Ice type to counter Water, and something else that can handle common attackers.

2. **Moves Compatibility**: Check if the chosen Pokémon have moves that can support each other's weaknesses, like status moves or heals.

3. **Max HP**: Higher max HP might help in surviving longer battles.

I should go through the remaining indices (since 24,40,37 are used) and evaluate each:

- Index 14: Ground/Electric
- Index 15: Steel/Dark
- Index 16: Fairy
- Index 17: Ground/Water
- Index 18: Poison
- Index 19: Fight
- Index 20: Rock
- Index 21: Electric/Ground
- Index 22: Electric
- Index 23: Grass/Fire
- Index 25: Electric
- Index 26: Fight
- Index 27: Fight
- Index 28: Poison
- Index 29: Water
- Index 30: Dragon/Bug
- Index 31: Steel/Grass
- Index 32: Fire/Ground
- Index 33: Fairy
- Index 34: Water/Steel
- Index 35: Fairy
- Index 36: Ghost
- Index 37: Ground (already used)
- Index 38: Dark/Normal
- Index 39: Fire
- Index 40: Ground (used)
- Index 41: Ground
- Index 42: Fairy
- Index 43: Poison
- Index 44: Grass
- Index 45: Fairy
- Index 46: Dragon/Poison
- Index 47: Ice
- Index 48: Dragon
- Index 49: Ice/Dark

So I need to pick three from these. Let's see which ones might be good.

Looking for types that can complement each other:

- A Rock type (like index 20) for Ground resistance.
- An Electric type (index 14,22,25) for support against Ground and Water.
- Maybe a Dragon or Bug type (index 30,46) because they have strong moves against certain types.

Alternatively, consider a Ghost type (index 36) which is good against Normal and Dark, but I don't know if that's necessary here.

Wait, the last result was a loss with Elo 1185. Maybe the opponent had strong physical attackers or specific types that were hard to counter.

Looking at index 30: Dragon/Bug. Dragon types can have strong moves against Water and Grass, which are common in the previous team (Water). Bug can handle Ground and Grass as well.

Index 14: Ground/Electric. Ground is already in the previous team, so maybe Electric can provide support with moves like Thunderbolt or others that can damage multiple types.

But wait, index 21 is also Electric/Ground, which might be too similar to 14. So perhaps choosing a different type.

Alternatively, index 46: Dragon/Poison. Dragon can handle Water and Ground, and Poison can deal with Grass and other types.

Another option is index 35: Fairy, which is strong against Dark and Normal, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, the previous team had two Grounds and a Water. So maybe the opponent has types that are resistant to Ground or Water. To counter that, having a Rock type (index 20) would help with Ground resistance and can take on physical attacks.

So perhaps choosing Rock (20), Electric/Ground (14), and Dragon/Bug (30). Let me see:

- Rock: Good against Ground, which was a big part of the previous team.
- Electric/Ground: Can handle Water and provide support with Electric moves.
- Dragon/Bug: Takes care of Water and Grass, which were also in the previous team.

Alternatively, maybe add more defensive types. Like index 47: Ice, which can deal with Water and Grass as well, but I'm not sure if that's better than Dragon/Bug.

Wait, index 30 is Dragon/Bug, which might have strong moves against Water and Ground, so that could be beneficial.

So putting it together:

- Index 14: Ground/Electric. Ground can handle multiple types, Electric adds offensive power.
- Index 20: Rock. Great for defense against Ground and physical attacks.
- Index 30: Dragon/Bug. Strong against Water and Grass, which were part of the previous team.

Alternatively, I could choose different types:

- Index 14, 30, 49: 14 is Ground/Electric, 30 is Dragon/Bug, 49 is Ice/Dark. Ice can handle Water and Grass, Dark provides some defense and moves against Normal, etc.

Wait, but the previous team had a lot of Ground and Water, so having two types that can take on those would be good.

So maybe:

- Ground/Electric (14) to cover both Ground and Electric attacks.
- Rock (20) for solid Ground resistance and physical defense.
- Dragon/Bug (30) to handle Water and Grass.

Alternatively, if I don't want three Ground types, perhaps mix in a Fairy or something else.

Wait, another approach: Since the previous team used Ground and Water, maybe include a Electric type to counter both. But index 14 is Ground/Electric, which might not be ideal as it's part Ground. So perhaps Electric alone would be better, but there are no pure Electric types left (since 22,25,28, etc., but 22 is Electric, so I can pick that.

Wait, index 22: Electric, Max HP 116. It has moves like Ghost, Power 77, which might not be as good.

Alternatively, index 14: Ground/Electric with higher HP (135). So perhaps it's better to include it for both types.

But maybe the best is a mix of Rock, Electric/Ground, and Dragon/Bug.

Wait, but I can only pick three. Let me think about their stats:

- Index 20: Rock, Max_HP=111. Moves include Fire, Accuracy 0.86, etc.
- Index 14: Ground/Electric, Max_HP=135. Moves include Flying, Electric, etc.
- Index 30: Dragon/Bug, Max_HP=82.

Alternatively, maybe pick higher HPs to survive longer. So index 40 (GROUND, 160 HP), which is high health. But does it cover good moves? Let me check:

Index 40: Ground, HP 160. Moves include Ice, Power 25, Accuracy 0.92, Max PP 6, etc. Maybe not the best.

Wait, but I need to balance between type coverage and stat.

Alternatively, perhaps index 14 (Ground/Electric) can provide both types, index 20 (Rock) for defense, and index 30 (Dragon/Bug) for Water/Grass.

Yes, that seems like a solid trio: Ground/Electric (for handling multiple types), Rock (defense against Ground and physical), Dragon/Bug (to counter Water and Grass).

So the final team would be indices 14,20,30.

Okay, so I need to help choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The user has lost their last battle and wants to maximize their chances in the next one. They provided a list of 49 Pokémon templates with types, max HP, and moves. Their previous team used indices [14, 20, 30], which I should consider.

First, I remember that after a loss, it's good to diversify the team to cover different types and strengths. The last result was a loss, so maybe the previous team had some weaknesses that led to the defeat. I should look for Pokémon that can complement each other in terms of type coverage and move compatibility.

Looking at the indices [14, 20, 30], let's see what each Pokémon is:

- Index 14: Ground/Electric. So it's a dual-type Pokémon with Ground and Electric moves.
- Index 20: Rock. Single type, Rock.
- Index 30: Dragon/Bug. Dual type, Dragon and Bug.

So their last team had Ground, Electric, and Rock along with Dragon/Bug. That covers multiple types, which is good for coverage. But maybe they were weak against certain types or moves that the opponent used.

Now, to build a new team, I need to ensure coverage of common types like Water, Fire, Grass, Ice, etc., without too much overlap. Also, considering move sets, having different types can help counter various opponents.

Looking through the roster again, I should pick three Pokémon that aren't overlapping in type with each other and cover a range of useful types. Let me consider some options:

1. Ground/Electric (14): Already used, but maybe adding another could be beneficial for coverage.
2. Rock (20): Useful against many types like Ice, Fire, etc.
3. Dragon/Bug (30): Good against Grass and Water.

But perhaps I can find better combinations. Let me look for:

- A strong Electric type to boost attack or provide STAB.
- A versatile Ground Pokémon with good moveset.
- Maybe a Fire or Water type that complements the team.

Wait, index 14 is already Ground/Electric. Maybe adding an Electric-type Pokémon could be redundant, but if it's better than the current one in terms of stats or moves, it might be worth considering. Alternatively, perhaps replacing one with another type.

Looking at other indices:

- Index 40: Ground. Could replace 14 because Ground is already covered by 20 and 30? Wait, no, 14 is Ground/Electric, so having two Ground types might not be ideal unless for coverage.

Wait, maybe I should aim for a team that covers multiple types without too much overlap. Let's see:

- Maybe include Electric (index 14) as it's dual-type and can handle both Ground and Electric moves.
- Include Rock (20) for solid defense and type coverage.
- Then, perhaps a Dragon/Bug (30) remains if it's strong.

Alternatively, maybe replace one of them with another type. Let me think: If I include a Water Pokémon, that could help against Dragon types and provide good moves like Hydro Pump. But looking through the list, is there a good Water Pokémon available?

Looking at index 29: Water. It has Water moves, which can be strong. Maybe replacing index 30 with 29 would give more Water coverage.

Wait, but then the team would have Ground/Electric (14), Rock (20), and Water (29). That covers Ground, Electric, Rock, and Water. Plus, the types are spread out nicely.

Alternatively, if I keep 30, which is Dragon/Bug, it can be good against Grass and Water opponents. Maybe having both is better for coverage.

Wait, perhaps index 40: Ground, with higher HP. But 14 is already Ground/Electric. Maybe including another Ground type might not be necessary unless it's significantly better.

Alternatively, let me look at the types that are strong in this roster. For example, Ice types can be strong against Rock and Grass. So maybe adding an Ice Pokémon would help.

Looking through the indices:

- Index 7: Flying/Fairy. Not sure if useful for coverage.
- Index 16: Fairy. Maybe not needed unless opponent has Dragon-type.
- Index 26: Fight. Maybe not as versatile.
- Index 28: Poison. Could be good against Grass and Water.
- Index 31: Steel/Grass. Provides both types, which can cover a lot.

Wait, perhaps including a Steel type could help with defense and provide coverage against Rock and Ice. Let me check index 5: Steel. It has high HP and Electric moves. Maybe that's a good addition.

So if I take:

- Index 14: Ground/Electric
- Index 20: Rock
- Index 5: Steel

This would give coverage in Ground, Electric, Rock, and Steel types. Plus, the Steel Pokémon can handle Electric attacks with STAB, which is useful.

Alternatively, perhaps including a Fire type could help against Grass and Ice. Let me see index 39: Fire. It has high HP and moves like Flame Thrower, which can be strong.

So another option:

- Index 14: Ground/Electric
- Index 20: Rock
- Index 39: Fire

This covers Ground, Electric, Rock, and Fire. Plus, Fire can handle Grass and Ice.

Another thought: Maybe including a Water type for coverage against Dragon types and for Hydro Pump moves. So perhaps index 29: Water.

So team:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 29: Water

This would cover Ground, Electric, Rock, and Water. Plus, the Water can handle Dragon opponents with moves like Hydro Pump.

Alternatively, maybe include a Grass type for coverage against Bug and Dragon. Let me see index 2: Ground/Fire. Or perhaps index 10: Grass. Index 10 is Grass with Ice moves, which could help against Dragon types.

So another possible team:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 10: Grass

This covers Ground, Electric, Rock, and Grass. Plus, the Grass can handle Bug and Dragon opponents.

But I need to ensure that each Pokémon is strong and provides good coverage without too much overlap.

Looking back at the previous team [14,20,30], which was Ground/Electric, Rock, and Dragon/Bug. So adding a third type would be better. The new team should have three types with minimal overlap and maximum coverage.

I think index 40 is a strong Ground Pokémon. It has Tailwind and Ignore Evasion, which could be useful in certain battles.

So perhaps:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 40: Ground

But that's two Ground types. Maybe it's too much, but if they are strong individually, it might be okay.

Alternatively, maybe index 37 is a strong Ground with higher HP (149). So 14, 20, 37:

- Ground/Electric, Rock, and another Ground. Again, two Grounds, which might not be ideal unless necessary.

Hmm. Maybe instead of Rock, include a Water type for better coverage against Dragon. So team:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 29: Water
- 30: Dragon/Bug

This would cover Ground, Electric, Water, and Dragon/Bug.

Alternatively, perhaps index 5 (Steel) is better because Steel can handle Electric attacks and provide good defense.

So final thought: To maximize coverage and have strong attackers, the best team might be:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 5: Steel

This gives coverage in four types: Ground, Electric, Rock, and Steel. Plus, the Steel can handle Electric attacks with STAB.

Alternatively, if I want to include a Fire type for broader coverage, then:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 39: Fire

But I'm not sure if this is better than the Steel option. Steel can also take care of Electric attacks.

Another consideration: The previous team lost, so maybe we need to switch up types for better synergy or defensive capabilities.

Looking at the previous team [14,20,30], which were Ground/Electric, Rock, and Dragon/Bug. They might have struggled against certain types like Water or Fairy.

So perhaps adding a type that counters common weaknesses would be good. For example, if the opponent is using Water, maybe include a Ground type for resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps including an Ice type to counter Dragon's weakness. So maybe:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 2: Ground/Fire (Ice moves)

This way, they can handle both Fire and Ice attacks, as well as have good defensive coverage.

But I need to make sure each Pokémon is strong individually. For example, index 2 has Max HP 113, which isn't the highest, but their moves include Electric and Ice, which are useful.

Alternatively, perhaps index 6: Rock/Ice. It can handle both Rock and Ice attacks. So team:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 6: Rock/Ice

This would cover Ground, Electric, Rock, and Ice. Plus, the Rock/Ice can take care of both types.

Another option is to include a Dragon-resistant type like Ice or Water. For example, index 29: Water. So:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 29: Water

This covers Ground, Electric, Rock, and Water. The Water can handle Dragon with Hydro Pump.

Alternatively, maybe including a Fairy type for status moves. Let me see index 7: Flying/Fairy. It has high HP (129) and useful moves. So:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 7: Flying/Fairy

This gives coverage in four types plus Fairy, which can help with status moves.

But I'm not sure if the Fairy type is necessary unless the opponent is using Ghosts or Psychic types.

Alternatively, perhaps including a Poison type for status and defense. Index 18: Poison. It has high HP (104) and strong moves like Protect and Water attacks.

So team:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 18: Poison

This would cover Ground, Electric, Rock, and Poison types. Plus, the Poison can handle Grass and Water opponents with status effects.

Hmm, it's a bit tough to decide which combination is best. I need to consider both type coverage and individual Pokémon strengths.

Maybe the key is to have:

1. A strong attacker with high damage moves.
2. Defensive types that can survive long battles.
3. Coverage against common weaknesses.

Looking at index 14: Ground/Electric, it has high HP (135) and useful moves like Flying for Electric attacks. It also provides Ground coverage which is good against Water and Grass.

Index 20: Rock, with high Max PP (14) and strong moves like Rock and Ice. It's a solid choice for both offense and defense.

Index 5: Steel, with high Max HP (126), strong physical attacks, and immunity to Electric. This would help in defending against Electric attacks, which are common in the roster.

Alternatively, index 29: Water, which can handle Dragon types with Hydro Pump. It also provides coverage for Water and Ground.

But I think having a Steel type is better because it can take care of Electric attacks, which are becoming more popular as many Pokémon have Electric moves.

So, putting it all together, the team would be:

- 14 (Ground/Electric) for ground coverage, high HP, and Electric attacks.
- 20 (Rock) for rock coverage, good PP, and defensive moves.
- 5 (Steel) for handling Electric and providing strong physical attacks.

This seems like a balanced team with good type coverage and individual strengths.

Another consideration is the previous result: they lost. So maybe they need more offensive power or better defensive moves. The Steel type has high Max HP and good defensive moves, so that might help in keeping the team alive longer.

In conclusion, after evaluating various options and considering both type coverage and individual Pokémon stats, I think the best new team would be indices 14, 20, and 5.

Alright, I need to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team from the given roster to maximize chances in the next battle. The previous team used indices [14, 20, 5], and the last result was a win with Elo 1181.03.

First, I'll look at the types of the previous team. The indices are 14, 20, and 5. Checking the roster:

- 14: Ground/Electric
- 20: Rock
- 5: Steel

So the last team had Ground, Electric, and Steel types. That covers multiple types which is good for coverage. Now, I need to consider what types are strong against each other or have synergy.

Ground beats Grass, Electric beats Water and Ice, and Steel can cover Electric and Rock. Looking at the roster, there are many options. My goal is to pick three Pokémon that can work well together, possibly with type advantages and strong moves.

I should check the types that are currently underrepresented or could be better. The previous team had Ground, Electric, Steel. Maybe adding another type that complements these would be good. For example, Fire is a common offensive type, or maybe Ice which is strong against Ground.

Looking at the available indices:

- 0: Rock
- 1: Ground/Dark
- 2: Ground/Fire
- 3: Bug
- 4: Ice/Psychic
- 5: Steel
- 6: Rock/Ice
- 7: Flying/Fairy
- 8: Dark/Ice
- 9: Fire/Flying
- 10: Grass
- 11: Normal/Steel
- 12: Bug
- 13: FIGHT
- 14: Ground/Electric
- 15: Steel/Dark
- 16: Fairy
- 17: Ground/Water
- 18: Poison
- 19: Fight
- 20: Rock
- 21: Electric/Ground
- 22: Electric
- 23: Grass/Fire
- 24: Water
- 25: Electric
- 26: Fight
- 27: Fight
- 28: Poison
- 29: Water
- 30: Dragon/Bug
- 31: Steel/Grass
- 32: Fire/Ground
- 33: Fairy
- 34: Water/Steel
- 35: Fairy
- 36: Ghost
- 37: Ground
- 38: Dark/Normal
- 39: Fire
- 40: Ground
- 41: Ground
- 42: Fairy
- 43: Poison
- 44: Grass
- 45: Fairy
- 46: Dragon/POISON
- 47: Ice
- 48: Dragon
- 49: Ice/Dark

I need to pick three that can work together. Let's consider type coverage:

Ground is already covered by 14, 20 (Rock), and maybe adding another Ground or Electric.

Looking at index 37: Ground with Max HP 149. It has moves like Grass, Accuracy 0.92, Max PP 7, OTHER, Disable, DARK, Max PP 7, OTHER, Self Switch, FIRE, etc. This could be a solid choice for Ground.

Index 14 is already used. Maybe using another Electric type? Index 25: Electric/Steel with Max HP 132. It has moves like ROCK, Max PP 9, SPECIAL, Probability 0.81, Heal 0.30, GROUND, etc. This could work well with Ground and maybe another type.

Wait, but the previous team already had Electric (index 14 is Ground/Electric). Maybe adding a Steel type again? Or perhaps a Rock type since index 20 is already used.

Alternatively, considering the last battle's result was a win, I might want to keep some of the same types for consistency. But also consider new strengths.

Looking at index 5: Steel with Max HP 126 and moves like ICE, Accuracy 0.89, etc. It could pair well with Electric (index 14) as Steel resists Electric.

Another option is index 6: Rock/Ice with Max HP 122. Rock can cover Ground and Ice can be useful against Water and Grass.

Wait, but the previous team had Rock at index 20. Maybe adding another Rock isn't necessary unless for coverage.

Alternatively, index 37: Ground could pair well with Electric (14) and perhaps a Fire type? Or maybe another Ground or Electric.

Looking at index 21: Electric/Ground, Max HP 79. It has moves like WATER, PARALYZED, NORMAL, etc. This could be a good choice for both Electric and Ground coverage.

But the previous team had Ground (14) and Rock (20). Maybe adding an Electric type that's strong would be good. Index 25: Electric/Steel. It can cover Electric and Steel, which is useful.

Wait, but index 5 is Steel, so maybe having two Steels isn't necessary unless for specific moves.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Ghost type? Or a Dragon type?

Looking at index 30: Dragon/Bug with Max HP 82. Moves like WATER, Power 134, etc. It could be useful against Water and Bug types, but I'm not sure if that's the best fit here.

Another consideration is the previous team's success; maybe sticking with similar types would help. So Ground, Electric, Steel seems solid.

So possible picks:

- Index 14: Ground/Electric
- Index 20: Rock
- Index 5: Steel

But wait, the user wants exactly three indices, not necessarily different from before, but perhaps a different combination.

Alternatively, if I can find three that are strong and have good coverage.

Another option is index 37 (Ground), index 14 (Ground/Electric), and index 25 (Electric/Steel). But that might be too much Ground and Electric.

Wait, maybe the user wants to avoid using the same types as before. Or perhaps not; it's better to use what worked.

Alternatively, let's look for high HP Pokémon with strong moves.

Looking at index 37: Ground with Max HP 149. That seems very strong.

Index 25: Electric/Steel with Max HP 132. Also strong.

Index 30: Dragon/Bug with Max HP 82. Maybe not the best HP, but good moves.

Wait, maybe a better choice would be:

- Index 37 (Ground)
- Index 14 (Ground/Electric)
- Index 25 (Electric/Steel)

But that's three, and they cover Ground, Electric, and Steel. That seems like solid coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Rock type (index 20) along with Ground and Electric.

Wait, the previous team had 14,20,5: Ground/Electric, Rock, Steel. So maybe adding another Ground or Electric wouldn't be bad.

But since the user wants to maximize chances, perhaps having three different types would be better.

So options could be:

- Ground (index37), Electric (index25), and Rock (index6).

Alternatively, index37 (Ground), index14 (Ground/Electric), and index5 (Steel). That way, it's Ground, Electric, Steel. Good coverage.

But maybe including a Dragon or other type for specific advantages.

Wait, but without knowing the specifics of the battle, it's hard to say. But considering previous success with Ground, Electric, Rock, Steel, perhaps keeping similar types would be best.

So possible team:

---37, 14, 5---

Alternatively, ---37,25,20--- if I want more recent types.

But I need to decide based on the data given.

Looking back at the instructions: The previous team won with indices [5,14,20]. So those were their choices. Now, they need to choose a new team from the roster, using three of the 49 available Pokémon.

Given that their last result was a win, and the team used 5,14,20, maybe sticking with similar types would be good.

But also, considering that each type can have different strengths. For example, Ground covers multiple types, Electric is strong against Water and Air, Steel is resistant to many types.

So perhaps choosing three Pokémon that cover a broad range of types and have high HP and strong moves.

Looking at the roster:

- Index 37: Ground with Max HP 149. Moves include GRASS, Accuracy 0.92, etc.
- Index14: Ground/Electric, Max HP 135. Moves like FLYING, etc.
- Index5: Steel, Max HP 126. Moves include ICE.

Alternatively, index6: Rock/Ice, which can cover Rock and Ice types.

So if I choose:

---37,14,6---

That gives Ground (index37), Ground/Electric (14), Rock/Ice (6). Covers multiple types.

But perhaps including a Dragon or Fire type for more coverage. But without knowing the exact needs, it's hard.

Alternatively, looking at index30: Dragon/Bug with Max HP 82. It might be useful against Water and Bug, but maybe not as strong overall.

Another consideration is the previous team's success; they had Ground, Electric, Rock, Steel. So perhaps choosing similar types would maintain their effectiveness.

In that case, I can choose:

---37,14,5---

Which are all from the previous team indices, but in a different combination.

Wait, but the user said "choose a new 3-Pokémon team" so they don't necessarily have to be different, but it's about picking any three from the roster. So perhaps including some of the same types as before would help.

But considering the previous team won with [5,14,20], which are Steel, Ground/Electric, Rock. Now, the new team could include similar types for consistency.

So possible choices:

- 5 (Steel), 14 (Ground/Electric), and another strong type like 37 (Ground) or 6 (Rock/Ice).

But to make it three indices, maybe choose 5,14,37.

Alternatively, if I want more diversity, perhaps include a Dragon or Bug type. But without knowing the exact opposing types, it's hard to say.

In conclusion, based on previous success with Ground, Electric, Steel, and Rock, choosing a team that includes these types would be logical.

So the new team could be:

---37,14,5---

But wait, 37 is Ground, 14 is Ground/Electric, and 5 is Steel. That covers multiple types: Ground, Electric, Steel.

Alternatively, including 20 (Rock) might add more coverage. So perhaps ---20,14,5---.

But the user's last result was a win with [5,14,20]. Now, choosing them again might be redundant. It's better to include different indices for variety, but I'm not sure if that affects success.

Since I don't have information about which types are strong against what, I'll go with a team that has high HP and strong moves across multiple types.

Looking at the data:

- Index 40: Ground with Max HP 160. Moves include ICE, Power 25, etc.
- Index37: Ground with Max HP149. Moves include GRASS, Accuracy 0.92, etc.
- Index5: Steel, Max HP126. Moves include ICE, etc.

So choosing ---40,37,5--- might be a good team.

Alternatively, considering the previous team won with [5,14,20], perhaps choosing similar types again will work.

But I think it's best to choose a mix of strong types and high HP. So maybe:

---37 (Ground), 14 (Ground/Electric), 5 (Steel).---

So ---37,14,5---.

Alternatively, including a Rock type could be useful, so maybe ---37,20,5---.

But without knowing the exact opposing types, it's hard to know which is better. So I'll proceed with the previous team indices but in a different combination.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user provided a lot of data about the Roster, which includes each Pokémon's type, max HP, and their moves. They also mentioned that the previous team won, with Elo being 1194.40. The last team used indices [5, 14, 37]. Now, I need to select three new indices from the Roster to form a new team.

I remember from the user's instructions that the goal is to maximize chances in the next battle. So, I should look for Pokémon that are strong against common opponents or have moves that can deal with various types effectively.

Looking at the previous team: indices 5, 14, and 37. Let me check their types:

- Index 5: Type STEEL/DARK
- Index 14: Type GROUND/ELECTRIC
- Index 37: Type GROUND

So, the last team had two Ground types and one Steel/Dark type. Maybe the next team should have complementary types to cover different weaknesses.

Now, I'll go through each Pokémon in the Roster to assess their potential:

Starting with index 0: Rock type. Rock is strong against Ice and Fire. If the previous team had Ground (which is weak against Rock), maybe having a Rock type could be good for switching advantage.

Index 1: Ground/Dark. Another Ground type, which might be helpful since Ground can handle Electric moves well and Dark covers Ghosts and Poisons.

Wait, but the previous team already has two Ground types. Maybe adding another Ground isn't necessary unless it's better in some way. Let me check their HP.

Index 1: Max HP 141
Index 14: Max HP 135
Index 37: Max HP 149

So, index 1 is actually the highest HP among the previous team, so maybe replacing one of them with a higher HP could be beneficial.

Alternatively, looking for types that can cover multiple weaknesses. For example, Electric types are good against Water and Ice, which might counter Ground's weakness to Water. But index 14 is already Electric/Ground, so maybe another Electric type isn't needed unless it has strong moves.

Wait, but the previous team used [5, 14, 37], which are Steel/Dark, Ground/Electric, and Ground. So their types cover a mix of Steel/Dark, Ground, and Electric. Maybe to counter the next possible team's types, I need to consider what's strong against common Pokémon.

Looking at index 30: Dragon/BUG. Dragon is weak to Ice but strong against Fire and Water. Bug is good against Grass and Psychic. So this could be a versatile addition.

Index 49: Ice/Dark. Ice is strong against Rock and Fire, while Dark can cover Ghosts and Poisons. This seems useful because it can handle both Fire and Ice types effectively.

Now, considering the moves:

For index 30, they have Water, Power 134, etc. That's a strong Water move, which could be effective against Ground (since Ground is weak to Water). Also, Bug moves can deal with Grass and Psychic types, which might be good for coverage.

Index 49 has Ice and Dark moves. Ice can handle Rock and Fire, and Dark covers Ghosts and Poisons. This seems like a solid choice because it complements the previous team's types well.

Looking at their HP:

Index 30: Max HP 82
Index 49: Max HP 70

Hmm, lower HP, but perhaps they have strong moves that make up for it.

Now, considering the team as a whole:

If I pick index 1 (Ground/Dark), it's another Ground type, which is good against Electric and has Dark to cover Ghosts. But maybe it's better to avoid having too many Ground types unless necessary. Alternatively, picking index 30 and 49 could provide more type coverage.

Wait, the previous team had two Ground types, so adding a third might not be necessary. Instead, perhaps choosing types that can cover other weaknesses, like Electric or Dark, would be better.

So, maybe:

- Index 1: Ground/Dark (covers another Ground and adds Dark)
- Index 30: Dragon/BUG (covers Bug and Dragon, which can handle various types)
- Index 49: Ice/Dark (adds Ice and strengthens Dark coverage)

But that's three indices. Alternatively, perhaps choosing the highest HP from other types.

Wait, maybe I should look for the best HP in each type to maximize survival chances.

Looking through the Roster:

Index 37 is Ground with Max HP 149 – the highest among Grounds.
Index 14: G/Electric, Max HP 135
Index 5: Steel/Dark, Max HP 126

So if I want high HP, perhaps index 37 is a good choice. But it's part of the previous team.

Wait, no, the indices are chosen each time, so as long as they're from the Roster. So, for example, in this case, the user wants to choose three new ones, not necessarily excluding any.

But since the last team won, maybe keeping some types that worked well is better, but also adding new strengths.

Alternatively, perhaps picking index 30 and 49 because they have unique types that can cover multiple weaknesses. For example, Dragon/BUG (index 30) can handle Water, Fire, Grass, etc., and Ice/Dark (index 49) covers Ice and Dark, which are useful against Fire and Ghosts.

So, putting it together:

- Index 1: Ground/Dark – for another Ground and Dark
- Index 30: Dragon/BUG – versatile coverage
- Index 49: Ice/Dark – strong against Ice and supports Dark

But that's three indices. Wait, the previous team used [5,14,37], which are Steel/Dark, G/Electric, and Ground.

So maybe in this case, to complement:

- Keep a Ground type (index 1 or 37)
- Add an Electric type for better coverage against Water
Wait, but index 14 is already Electric/Ground. So maybe adding another Electric isn't necessary unless it's stronger.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing the highest HP from different types.

Looking at the Roster again, the highest HP Pokémon are:

Index 24: Water, Max HP 160
Index 37: Ground, Max HP 149
Index 40: Ground, Max HP 160

So, index 40 is another Ground with high HP. Maybe adding that for more HP.

But then I need two other types to cover different weaknesses.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing the highest HP from each of the desired types.

Wait, but the user wants exactly three indices. So, maybe:

- Index 37: Ground (high HP)
- Index 30: Dragon/BUG
- Index 49: Ice/Dark

This gives a mix of high HP, versatile type, and strong offensive types.

Alternatively, maybe including index 1 (Ground/Dark) as it has higher HP than 30 and 49.

But I think the main goal is to have a team that can handle various types effectively. So, Ground covers Electric and Water, Dark covers Ghosts, Ice covers Fire, and Dragon covers Grass and more.

So, perhaps:

- Index 1 (Ground/Dark): Ground and Dark
- Index 30 (Dragon/BUG): Dragon and Bug
- Index 49 (Ice/Dark): Ice and Dark

But that's two Dark types. Maybe it's better to have one of each needed type.

Alternatively, maybe index 14 (G/Electric), which is part of the previous team but has high HP, and add others.

Wait, in this case, since the last result was a win, maybe keeping some strong types from the previous team is good. The previous team used indices [37,14,5], which are Ground, G/Electric, Steel/Dark.

So, if I want to keep similar strengths:

- Keep Ground (index 37)
- Keep Electric/Ground (index 14)
- Replace Steel/Dark with something else.

But the user wants to choose three new indices. So perhaps replacing one of them.

Wait, no, the problem says "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster". It doesn't specify whether it's a completely different team or can reuse types as long as the indices are new.

So, I think the approach is to select three Pokémon that together cover effective types and have high HP.

Given that, I might look for:

- A Ground type (for Electric and Water resistance)
- An Ice type (to handle Fire and Grass)
- A Dragon or Dark type (to cover various weaknesses)

Alternatively, perhaps the best bet is to pick the highest HP from each of these types.

Looking at the Roster again:

Ground: index 37 (149), index 40 (160), index 41 (119)
Ice/Dark: index 49 (70)
Dragon/BUG: index 30 (82)

But I think for this scenario, considering that the last team won with indices [5,14,37], which are Steel/Dark, G/Electric, Ground.

So perhaps in the next battle, to maximize effectiveness:

- Keep a Ground type (index 37)
- Add an Electric type (already have index 14)
- Maybe add an Ice type or Dark type.

But since we need three indices, perhaps replacing one of them.

Alternatively, pick the highest HP from different types.

Looking for high HP in each useful type:

Ground: index 37 (149), 40 (160), 41 (119)
Electric: index 14 (135), 25 (132)
Ice/Dark: index 49 (70)
Dragon/BUG: index 30 (82)

So, if I pick the highest HP for Ground (index 40: 160), then maybe another type.

But perhaps to maximize, take:

- Ground (high HP) → index 37 or 40
- Electric (already used in last team as index14)
- Ice/Dark (for additional coverage)

Wait, but I need three indices. So if I pick index37 (Ground), index14 (Electric/Ground), and index49 (Ice/Dark). That gives:

- Ground: two types (index37 and 14) – but actually, index14 is Electric/Ground, so it's a single type with dual typing.
- Ice/Dark: one type.

But perhaps having three different types would be better. So maybe:

- One Ground
- One Electric
- One Ice or Dragon

Alternatively, considering that the previous team had G/Electric and Steel/Dark, which covers Electric and Dark. Adding a third type, say Ice, to cover Fire resistance and add more coverage.

So, pick index37 (Ground), index14 (G/Electric), and index49 (Ice/Dark). That would give:

- Ground: 37
- Electric/Ground:14 → same as G
- Ice/Dark:49

But that's two Ground types? Or no, because index14 is Electric/Ground, so it's one type with dual. So the team has three Pokémon: Ground, Electric/Ground, and Ice/Dark.

Alternatively, maybe replacing index5 (Steel/Dark) with another type.

Wait, but the instruction says "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster", which probably means selecting any three indices regardless of previous use, as long as they are allowed.

But the main goal is to choose the best possible team for the next battle.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is:

- Choose the highest HP Pokémon with types that cover multiple weaknesses.
- Ensure coverage against common attacking types in the current meta.

Looking at the Roster, the highest HPs are:

- 37: Ground, Max_HP=149
- 40: Ground, Max_HP=160
- 24: Water, 160
- 39: Fire, 153
- 26: Fight, 71

But let's think about types that can cover multiple effective moves.

Ground covers Electric and Water, which are common attacking types.
Ice can handle Fire and Grass.
Dragon is good against Grass and Fire.

Alternatively, Dark covers Ghost, but if we have Ground and Electric, maybe adding Ice or Dragon would be better for coverage.

Also, considering that in the previous battle, the team had [37,14,5], which are Ground, G/Electric, Steel/Dark. So perhaps keeping Ground and Electric is good. Adding a third type that covers another weakness.

Looking at the current Roster, index40 (Ground) has very high HP of 160. It's a pure Ground type with Tailwind, which boosts allies' moves.

So, maybe picking 37 (149), 14 (135, G/Electric), and 40 (160, Ground).

But 40 is another Ground, so perhaps that's redundant. Maybe better to pick 37 (Ground) + 14 (G/Electric) + a third type like Ice or Dragon.

Looking at the highest HP for Ice/Dark: index49 has only 70 HP, which isn't great. The highest HP for Dragon/BUG is index30 with 82 HP.

Alternatively, perhaps picking 37 (149), 14 (135), and 30 (82). That gives:

- Ground (37) + Electric/Ground (14) + Dragon/BUG (30).

This team would have coverage against Electric and Water attacks via Ground, and Dragon can handle Grass and Fire. It also has high HP overall.

Another consideration is the moves each Pokémon has. For example, index37 has Tailwind which boosts allies, but no moves that are particularly strong.

Alternatively, looking for Pokémon with strong special moves or high PP to survive longer in battles.

But without knowing the exact opposing team's types, it's hard to optimize further.

So, considering all this, I think selecting indices 37 (Ground), 14 (Electric/Ground), and 30 (Dragon/BUG) would be a good team with solid coverage and decent HP.

Alright, so I just got this query where I need to help build a Pokémon team based on a simplified version of Pokémon. The user is asking me to choose three Pokémon from a given roster to maximize their chances in the next battle. They also provided some specific information: it's their first battle with no prior results.

First, I should understand what exactly the user needs. They want three indices from the roster, each corresponding to a Pokémon template. The goal is to select the best team possible given that they haven't won any battles before.

Looking at the data provided, there are 50 Pokémon templates, each with their type, max HP, and a list of moves along with various stats like accuracy, priority, etc. My task is to evaluate these and choose the top three that will perform well in battle.

Since it's their first battle, I don't have any prior results to base on. So, I need to look for Pokémon that are strong in general, maybe good all-rovers or ones with versatile moves. Maybe something that can adapt to different situations.

I should consider the types and moves of each Pokémon. High HP is important because it helps sustain during battles. Moves with high accuracy and power could be beneficial. Also, considering the battlefield advantages like priority, recoil, etc., might give them an edge.

Let me go through some of the higher HP Pokémon first. For example, indices 0 has a Max HP of 152, which is quite high. It also has moves like Power 101, which seems strong. But I need to check if those moves are effective against common types or not.

Index 2 is type Flying/Fairy with Max HP 151. That's almost as high. The moves include some good ones like Power 84 and Light Screen, which can protect the team. Index 35 has a FIGHT type with 158 HP, but I'm not sure about its moves yet.

Wait, index 0 is Type Flying/ Dragon. It has moves that cover both Flying and Dragon types, which might be useful against certain opponents. The Accurate Move list seems strong too.

Index 30 is Type Fairy/Dragon with Max HP 124. Fairy can be good for offensive moves, and Dragon type can have strong attacks. Plus, it has Force Switch, which can swap types in battle, adding more flexibility.

Looking at the moves, I should prioritize ones that are effective against common typings or have high accuracy. For example, index 2 has a Light Screen move, which is defensive and useful.

Index 35's FIGHT type has some strong physical moves like Power 73 and Reflect, which can help in battles by reducing damage taken.

Now, considering synergy, maybe having a mix of types would be better. Flying/ Dragon, Fairy/ Dragon, and FIGHT could cover different aspects: offensive, defensive, and tanking.

I should also check for moves that provide boosts or protections. For example, index 0 has Target Boosts which can enhance the effectiveness of moves.

Wait, index 2's moves include Force Switch, which allows switching types mid-battle. That's a great asset because it can adapt to the opponent's weaknesses.

Index 30's moves also have Tailwind, which increases speed, so their attacks go first. That could be a big advantage in battle.

So, putting this together: index 0 for high HP and strong moves, index 2 for defensive and versatile moves, and index 35 for tanking and strong physical attacks. This combination should provide a well-rounded team that can handle various opponents.

Alright, so I need to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster will maximize my chances in the next battle. The user mentioned that their last team lost, and their Elo is now 1185. They also provided a detailed Roster with each Pokémon's type, max HP, and moves.

First, I should consider what factors contribute to winning battles. Typically, in Pokémon battles, having effective moves against your opponents' types is crucial. So, I need to look at the types of the last team used (indices 30, 0, 35) and see what types they were.

Looking up the indices:
- Index 30: Type FLYING/DRAGON
- Index 0: Type FLYING/DRAGON
- Index 35: Type FIGHT

So, the previous team had two Flying/Dragon Pokémon and one Fighthing type. Since their last battle resulted in a loss, maybe their team composition wasn't optimal against the opposing types.

Now, to build a new team, I should focus on types that can effectively counter common opponents or have strong moves against them. Also, considering the previous loss, perhaps adding Pokémon that can boost defense or have strong offensive moves would be beneficial.

Looking through the roster, I need to find three Pokémon that together cover multiple types and have good moves that can take down various opponents.

Let me start by identifying each Pokémon's type:

- 0: FLYING/DRAGON
- 30: FLYING/DRAGON
- 35: FIGHT

So the previous team was strong on Flying/Dragon, which is great for versatility, but maybe too reliant on those types. To mix things up, perhaps adding a Pokémon from another type that can complement or counter their strengths.

Looking at other indices:

I notice that index 48 is Type FIGHT. That might be useful since the previous team already has a Fighting type (index 35). Maybe having two Fighting types isn't ideal because they could have redundant coverage.

Alternatively, adding a Ghost type could be beneficial against Dark or Poison types, which are common in many Pokémon. Looking for a Ghost type, I see indices like 7 and 17.

Another option is to add a Rock type, which can counter Flying types effectively. Indexes like 19 and 34 have Rock types.

Also, considering the previous loss, maybe the team's moves weren't strong enough against the opposing types. So, including Pokémon with high Accuracy or powerful moves might help.

Looking at index 40: Type ICE. This could be useful if there are Ice-type opponents, but it's also a neutral type that can support through heals or boosts.

Index 49: FLYING. Adding another Flying type could provide more coverage, especially against Ground and Rock types.

Alternatively, adding a Psychic type (indices like 1, 6, 11) could help with moves like Trickroom or Light Screen, which can boost the team's effectiveness.

Wait, but the previous team had two Flying/Dragon types. Adding another Flying might be redundant unless it has unique moves that synergize well.

Another consideration is the move sets of each Pokémon. For example, a Psychic type with Tailwind or Trickroom could significantly boost attack or defense.

Let me think about possible combinations:

Option 1: Two Flyers and a Psychic.
- Flyers for versatility against various types.
- Psychic for support moves like Tailwind or Trickroom.

Looking at index 26: Type PSYCHIC. It has moves like Ice, which is useful against Dragon types, and Tailwind, which boosts attack.

So, team could be indices 30 (FLYING/DRAGON), 0 (FLYING/DRAGON), and 26 (PSYCHIC). But wait, the previous team already used two Flyers. Maybe I need to replace one with a different type.

Alternatively, index 49: FLYING. It has moves like Light Screen, which could protect against certain status moves.

Wait, but index 30 is also FLYING/DRAGON, so having another Flyer might not add much unless it's better in some aspect.

Looking at the types, maybe adding a Rock type to counter Flying would be good. So, index 19: Type ROCK. It has moves like Stealth Rock and Rock Throw which can take down Flying opponents.

So, perhaps team indices 30 (FLYING/DRAGON), 19 (ROCK), and 26 (PSYCHIC). That gives a mix of types that can cover each other's weaknesses.

Alternatively, index 34: Type GRASS. It has moves like Light Screen, which is useful, but Grass isn't directly counters to Flying unless it uses moves like Gust or Solar Beam.

Hmm, maybe not as effective as Rock for countering Flyers.

Another option is index 7: Type DARK. Dark types have access to moves like Sucker Punch, which can be strong against Fighting types. So if we include a Dark type, it could help against the previous team's Fighting type (index 35). But since we need three Pokémon, maybe including 0, 30, and 7.

Wait, but 0 and 30 are both Flying/Dragon, so adding another type would be better.

Alternatively, index 36: Type FLYING. It has moves like Toxic Spikes, which can poison opponents, useful against Grass and Ground types.

But again, maybe overlapping with the previous team's strengths.

I think a good strategy is to have one strong attacker, a support type, and a counter-type. For example:

- A high HP type for defense.
- A type that can boost attack or defend.
- A type with moves that can take down common opponents.

Looking at index 34: Type GRASS. It has Light Screen which could be useful, but not sure about its offensive capabilities.

Wait, maybe the best approach is to look for the highest HP in the roster and then choose types that can complement each other.

The highest HP is 160 (indices 8, 29). But adding two of them might not be optimal. Maybe one high HP and some offensive types.

Alternatively, index 30: FLYING/DRAGON has decent HP at 124. Index 49: FLYING has 136 HP. So combining these with a strong support type like index 26 (PSYCHIC) which can boost the team's effectiveness.

So perhaps team indices 30, 49, and 26.

But I need to check their move sets:

- 30: Moves include Tailwind, which boosts attack.
- 49: Has moves like Light Screen and Protect, which are useful for defense.
- 26: Has Tailwind and Trickroom, but also some status moves.

Wait, but the previous team used indices [30,0,35]. So I need to choose a new team without using those indices again unless necessary.

But the problem says "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster that will maximize your chances in the next battle." It doesn't specify whether it's allowed to reuse types or not. But each Pokémon is unique by index, so I can include them as long as their types aren't overlapping in a way that's disadvantageous.

Wait no, each index is a different Pokémon template. So even if two have same type, they can be used together because they're different Pokémon with possibly different movesets.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's better to spread out the types to cover more weaknesses.

Another thought: Maybe pick the three highest HP Pokémon in the roster.

Looking at the data:

- Index 8: 160
- Index 29: 160
- Index 34: 124
- Index 35: 158
- Index 36: 151
- Index 40: 150

So top HPs are 160,160,158,151,150.

But maybe having three high HPs is good for defense. So perhaps indices 8 (STEEL/GHOST),29 (POISON),35 (FIGHT).

But I need to see their types and moves:

- 8: STEEL/GHOST – can use moves like Disable, which is useful against FIGHT type.
- 29: POISON – has good offensive moves.
- 35: FIGHT – strong attacker with moves like Power Charge.

This could be a solid team. But I need to check if they have any weaknesses that could be exploited by the opponents.

Alternatively, perhaps include a Water and Fire type for coverage.

Wait, maybe it's better to pick a balanced team with types that can cover each other.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to optimize. So perhaps picking high HP and good offensive/defensive moves is better.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon with strong STABs (Same Type Attack Boost) or wide coverage.

Looking at index 30: FLYING/DRAGON has Tailwind which boosts attack when on the field. Also, Dragon has access to moves like Power 101 and such.

Index 49: FLYING – has Light Screen which reduces Special damage, useful against Ghosts and Psychic types.

Index 26: PSYCHIC – can handle Ghost and Dark types well.

So perhaps team of 30 (FLYING/DRAGON), 49 (FLYING), and 26 (PSYCHIC). But two Flying types might be redundant unless for coverage. Alternatively, maybe one FLYING, one DRAGON, and a Psychic.

Wait, but index 26 is already Psychic. Maybe that's sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps index 30, 49, and another type to cover their weaknesses.

Wait, let's think about the last result: the team lost. Elo dropped. So maybe they need better coverage against certain types.

Looking at the previous team indices [30,0,35], which are:

- 30: FLYING/DRAGON
- 0: FLYING/DRAGON (different index but same type)
Wait no, index 0 is Type=FLYING/DRAGON? Wait let me check.

Looking back:

Roster entries:

Index 0: Type=FLYING/DRAGON?

Wait the user provided the list as:

0: PkmTemplate(Type=FLYING/DRAGON, Max_HP=152, ...)

Yes. So previous team was [30,0,35], which are FLYING/DRAGON (index30), FLYING/DRAGON (index0), and FIGHT (index35).

Hmm, so that's two Dragon/Flying types and one FIGHT.

If they lost, maybe their type coverage wasn't good enough. So perhaps to choose a new team without relying on Dragon/Flying too much.

Alternatively, pick different types that can cover each other.

But I'm not sure about the exact strategies here. Since it's a simplified version of Pokémon, perhaps the main thing is to maximize HP and have good attack/defensive moves.

Looking at index 8 (STEEL/GHOST): high HP 160, has Disable which is useful against FIGHT types.

Index29: POISON – has STAB for Poison moves, and can deal with Ghosts.

Index35: FIGHT – strong physical attacks but weak to Ghost moves.

Wait, but if they lost before, maybe their team composition was too weak against certain types. So perhaps switching out some members.

Alternatively, index34 (GRASS) or others might be better.

But without knowing the specific opponent types, it's tricky. Maybe choosing higher HP and strong attacking moves is better.

In any case, I think the best approach is to select three Pokémon that have high HP, useful moves, and cover different types to handle a variety of opponents.

Looking at the Roster:

Index 40: ICE – high HP, can use Protect and Ice moves. Maybe useful for defensive purposes.

Index 34: GRASS – covers Grass type, which is useful against Bug and others. Also has Light Screen.

Index 49: FLYING – has Light Screen as well, good for defense.

Alternatively, maybe indexes 34 (GRASS), 30 (FLYING/DRAGON), and 40 (ICE). But not sure.

Wait, considering that the previous team had two Dragon/Flying and a FIGHT type, which might have been weak against certain types like Ghost or Dark. So perhaps adding a Psychic type would help with those.

So maybe pick index26 (PSYCHIC) along with others.

Alternatively, perhaps indexes 30 (FLYING/DRAGON), 34 (GRASS), and 40 (ICE). That covers multiple types for coverage.

But honestly, without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to predict. So I'll have to make an educated guess based on high HP and useful move sets.

Looking at index35: FIGHT – Max PP is 13, which is decent. But FIGHT type can be weak against Ghosts unless they have Dark or something.

Index8: STEEL/GHOST – High HP, has Disable which can prevent FIGHT moves.

Index29: POISON – Good for dealing with Ghost and Psychic types.

So perhaps a team of index35 (FIGHT), index8 (STEEL/GHOST), and index29 (POISON). But then the previous team had similar members? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe go for higher HP:

Index40: ICE – 150 HP
Index34: GRASS – 124 HP
Index49: FLYING –136 HP

This gives a total of around 500 HP. That's decent.

But I don't know if their moves cover each other's weaknesses.

Alternatively, maybe pick a Dark type for coverage against Psychic and others.

Looking at index21 (DARK/ICE): Max HP 134, has Rock move, etc.

Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to choose the top three highest HP Pokémon, as higher HP can survive more attacks.

Checking the Max_HP:

Index0:152

Index1:89

Index2:151

Index3:55

Index4:61

Index5:82

Index6:109

Index7:92

Index8:160

Index9:136

Index10:139

Index11:106

Index12:131

Index13:138

Index14:110

Index15:108

Index16:125

Index17:119

Index18:75

Index19:148

Index20:102

Index21:134

Index22:104

Index23:131

Index24:115

Index25:116

Index26:106

Index27:116

Index28:74

Index29:160

Index30:124

Index31:84

Index32:94

Index33:112

Index34:124

Index35:158

Index36:151

Index37:135

Index38:107

Index39:112

Index40:150

Index41:158

Index42:157

Index43:139

Index44:160

Index45:73

Index46:92

Index47:126

Index48:142

Index49:136

So the top 3 Max_HP are:

Index0:152

Index8:160

Index29:160

index40:150

So perhaps pick those.

But I need to pick exactly three, and previous team was [30,0,35], so can't use them again? Or is there a restriction?

Wait, the instructions don't say anything about not reusing indices. So maybe it's allowed.

But the problem says "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster that will maximize your chances in the next battle." So likely, you have to choose any three, regardless of previous ones.

So perhaps pick the highest HPs: 0,8,29.

But let me check their types:

Index0: FLYING/DRAGON

Index8: STEEL/GHOST

Index29: POISON

This gives a team with different types, which can cover various opponents.

Alternatively, maybe include a Dark or Psychic type for better coverage against certain opponents.

So perhaps choose index0 (FLYING/DRAGON), index44 (PSYCHIC/GRASS), and index40 (ICE). Or something like that.

But I'm not sure. Since the last battle resulted in loss, maybe the team was weak against certain types.

Alternatively, pick high HP with good movesets.

Wait, the problem might require selecting based on the previous result to adjust the team.

The last result was a loss, so perhaps the previous team's composition led to the loss, and we need to choose a better team.

But without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to know what types they are weak against.

So perhaps the best approach is to pick the top 3 highest HP Pokémon, assuming that higher HP gives better survivability.

Looking at the Max_HP:

Index0:152

index8:160

index29:160

These are the top three. So maybe choose these indices:0,8,29.

But let me check their types:

index0: FLYING/DRAGON

index8: STEEL/GHOST

index29: POISON

So types covered: Flying, Steel, Poison.

Alternatively, perhaps a team with more coverage would be better. But without knowing the opponent's weakness, it's hard to say.

But considering that in the last battle, they lost, maybe their moves weren't effective. So perhaps choosing Pokémon with strong moves can help.

Looking at each of these:

index0: Has some strong moves like Power 101, Accuracy 0.93, etc.

index8: STEEL/GHOST: GHOST has good moves, but not sure about Steel's effectiveness.

index29: POISON: Poison is a good type, but maybe not the best against certain opponents.

Alternatively, perhaps picking index44 (PSYCHIC/GRASS) would help with Psychic terrain support or coverage.

But I'm overcomplicating. The problem says to choose based on maximizing chances, using only Roster, Previous Team, and Last Result.

Since the last result was a loss, perhaps the previous team had certain weaknesses that can be addressed by choosing different types.

But without knowing the opponent's type composition, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe pick Pokémon with high accuracy and strong moves to ensure they can hit opponents effectively.

Looking at index0: has multiple strong moves, including Power 101 and Accuracy 0.93.

index8: STEEL/GHOST: GHOST has good moves like Max PP 10, etc.

index29: POISON: Has some strong moves, but maybe not the best accuracy.

Alternatively, perhaps pick index7 (DARK) which can have moves like Tailwind or Reflect.

But considering that I need to choose three, and the highest HPs are 0,8,29, which are 152,160,160. So those might be the safest choices for higher survival.

Therefore, my answer would be ---0, 8, 29---.

Wait, but the previous team was [30,0,35]. The problem doesn't state any restriction on using these indices again. So it's allowed.

But perhaps including index30 which is FAIRY/DRAGON with Max_HP=124 might be better in certain matchups.

Alternatively, I'm not sure. But given the information, choosing the top three HPs seems logical.

Okay, so I've been given this task to help build a Pokémon team for a simplified version of Pokémon. The user provided a lot of data, including a roster of Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves. They also mentioned that the last battle resulted in a loss, and now I need to choose a new team from the roster to maximize chances in the next battle.

First, let me understand what's required. The user wants exactly three indices from the roster, formatted as ---i1, i2, i3---. No extra text or explanations, just the indices. So my job is to pick the best three Pokémon from the given roster based on some criteria.

The previous team that lost had indices [0, 8, 29]. I should consider what those Pokémon were like and see if there's a pattern or strategy to improve upon that loss. Maybe their types weren't effective against the opposing team's types, or perhaps their moves didn't cover certain weaknesses.

Looking at the last result: "Your last team lost. Your new Elo is 1168.71." So they lost the last battle and now have this Elo rating. I'm not sure how the Elo is calculated here, but it gives me an idea that the previous team wasn't strong enough.

Now, looking at the roster, each Pokémon has a type, max HP, and a list of moves with their power, accuracy, and other stats like priority or recoil. My goal is to find three Pokémon that can complement each other in terms of types, coverage, and overall effectiveness in battles.

I think I should start by examining the types available. The previous team had indices 0 (Type FLYING/DRAGON), 8 (Type STEEL/GHOST), and 29 (Type POISON). Their types were a mix of Flying, Steel, and Poison. Maybe their types weren't effective against certain types or didn't cover all weaknesses.

To improve, I should look for Pokémon that can cover multiple types, have strong moves that can deal with common opponents, and have good defensive stats to survive longer. Also, considering the previous loss, perhaps they lacked certain resistances or had moves that weren't effective.

Looking through the roster, I'll try to find Pokémon with types that are strong against each other, maybe some that can handle multiple roles: attacker, wall, or setter. For example, a Ghost type could be good for disrupting opponents, while a Steel type can provide resistance and boost attack or defense.

I should also consider the moves each Pokémon has. Moves like Protect, Reflect, Safeguard are useful for support roles, allowing the team to survive longer. High accuracy and power moves can help in dealing consistent damage.

Let me go through some of the higher HP Pokémon first since they might be more durable. For example, index 0 has FLYING/DRAGON with high Max HP. But maybe it lacks certain resistances or has weaker moves compared to others.

Looking at index 30: Type FAIRY/DRAGON, Max HP 124. It has moves like Protect and Tailwind, which are great for support. Also, its type combination can be useful against various opponents.

Another good candidate might be index 8: STEEL/GHOST with high Max HP, but maybe it was part of the previous team that lost. Perhaps replacing one member would be better.

Wait, the user mentioned the previous team used indices [0, 8, 29], so I shouldn't include those again? Or is it allowed to reuse them if they're still effective?

Hmm, the instructions didn't specify not to reuse, so maybe it's okay. But perhaps using different Pokémon could provide better synergy or overcome their previous loss.

I'll also look at index 49: FLYING with Max HP 136 and moves like Light Screen and Force Switch, which can help set up screens and confuse opponents. This seems useful for controlling the battlefield.

Another option is index 37: FLYING with ICE type. It has high accuracy and some strong moves, but maybe it's not as versatile as others.

I should also check for resistances like Steel, Ghost, or Fairy against common attacking types to make the team more resilient.

Putting this all together, I think a good strategy is to have one Pokémon with strong support moves (like Protect or Tailwind), another that can deal consistent damage with high accuracy, and a third that covers multiple types effectively.

So, considering index 30 (FAIRY/DRAGON) for its support moves and type coverage, index 8 (STEEL/GHOST) for resistance and utility, and index 49 (FLYING) for versatility in both offense and defense. Alternatively, maybe replace one with another that has better attacking stats.

Wait, the user's previous team was [0,8,29], which are all quite strong individually but perhaps didn't work well together. So maybe choosing a more balanced or complementary trio would be better.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon with high Special Attack or physical attack power, ensuring that they can take down opponents effectively.

I'll need to balance the team so each member has a role: attacker, wall, and possibly a setter. This way, the team isn't too dependent on one member and can handle various threats.

After considering all these factors, I think indices 30 (FAIRY/DRAGON), 8 (STEEL/GHOST), and 49 (FLYING) could form a strong team. The Fairy/Dragon type provides good resistances and support moves, the Steel/Ghost adds durability and utility, and the Flying type offers versatility in both offense and defense.

Alternatively, maybe including index 14 (ELECTRIC/FIGHT) for its STUN ability or other useful moves. But I'm not sure if it's better than the previous options.

Wait, the last result was a loss with Elo around 1168, so perhaps the team needs more offensive power to win more often.

So maybe replacing index 0 (which is FLYING/DRAGON) with another strong attacker like index 35 (FIGHT) could help. But I need to ensure that the team still has good support and resistance.

This is getting a bit complicated, but based on the information given, I think selecting indices 30, 8, and 49 would provide a balanced and effective team.

Alright, I need to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, each time I receive a query, I have access to a roster of 49 Pokémon templates. Each has a Type, Max_HP, and various Moves with their details like power, accuracy, priority, etc. My task is to select exactly three Pokémon from this roster that will maximize my chances in the next battle.

The inputs provided are:
1. **Roster**: A list of all 49 Pokémon templates with their specifics.
2. **Previous Team**: The last team used had indices [30, 8, 49].
3. **Last Result**: The team lost, and the new Elo is 1151.03.

From this, I need to pick a new team. The goal is to maximize chances in the next battle, so I should focus on selecting Pokémon that are strong against what the previous team was weak against or that have high damage output or good defensive stats.

First, let me analyze the last team's composition. The indices used were 30, 8, and 49. Let me look up each of these in the roster:

- **Index 30**: Type is Fairy/Dragon with Max_HP 124.
- **Index 8**: Type is Electric/Water with Max_HP 115.
- **Index 49**: Type is Flying with Max_HP 136.

So, the previous team had:
- A Fairy/Dragon type
- An Electric/Water type
- A Flying type

I need to think about what types these are strong against and what they might be weak against. 

Looking at each Pokémon's type:

1. **Fairy/Dragon (30)**: Fairy is generally good against Dragon, Dark, and Ice types. So this Pokémon would have advantages over those types.
2. **Electric/Water (8)**: Electric is strong against Water, Ground, and Rock. It can also be weak to Ice, but that's only if it's fighting an Ice-type.
3. **Flying (49)**: Flying is good against Bug, grass, and small Pokémon, but here it might be used for versatility or coverage.

Now, since the last team lost, I need to think about what types were probably countered by the opponent. Alternatively, maybe the opponent had strong types that the previous team couldn't handle.

But without knowing the exact opponent's team, it's a bit tricky. However, a common strategy is to ensure that the new team has coverage against common typings or strong moves.

Looking at the roster, I should pick Pokémon that can cover multiple types, have high Max_HP for defense, or have powerful moves.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon with good defensive stats, high accuracy, or moves that can boost effectiveness. Also, considering types that are currently popular or strong in the meta could be beneficial.

I also notice that some Pokémon have unique abilities or boosts that can make them stronger. For example, index 30 has Self Boosts which might help in certain situations.

Let me think about the types that are currently strong:

- Electric and Water (since index 8 is Electric/Water)
- Fairy/Dragon
- Flying

But maybe the opponent had Ground-type Pokémon or something that the previous team couldn't handle. So, to counter that, I should include a type that's strong against Ground.

Looking at the roster, some strong types against Ground are:

- Electric: Since index 8 is already Electric/Water.
- Rock: But there's no Rock in the new team yet.
- Ice: Not sure if that's available.

Wait, perhaps I can pick a Pokémon that covers another weakness. For example, if the opponent had a lot of Fire types, having an Electric or Water might not be enough. Alternatively, maybe picking a Dark type for resistance against certain moves.

Alternatively, looking at the moves each Pokémon has:

- Index 30: Has Fairy and Dragon moves, including Power 80 and Force Switch.
- Index 8: Electric/Water with Power 48 and Change Type.
- Index 49: Flying with Light Screen and FLYING moves.

Perhaps I should look for a Pokémon that can perform well in close combat or has strong physical moves. High power moves are always beneficial.

Another thing is considering the previous team's Elo drop, so maybe the opponent had some strong Pokémon that the last team couldn't handle. To counteract that, choosing stronger or more resilient Pokémon would help.

Looking at the roster, I should prioritize Pokémon with high Max_HP for better survivability and higher chances of winning.

Let me list out possible candidates:

- **Index 0**: Flying/Dragon. Good moves, decent HP.
- **Index 1**: Psychic. High accuracy, but lower HP.
- **Index 2**: Flying/Fairy. High HP and good moves.
- **Index 3**: Poison. Can be strong against Grass and Water.
- **Index 4**: Dark/Fire. Could be useful for coverage.
- **Index 5**: Fairy/Rock. Good against Rock types.
- **Index 6**: Bug/Water. Useful if the opponent has Ground or Rock.
- **Index 7**: Dark. Strong against Light Screen and such.
- **Index 8**: Already used.
- **Index 9**: Ghost/Ice. Good for certain terrains.
- **Index 10**: Ghost/Dark. Good against others.
- **Index 11**: Water/Psychic. Could be strong against Fire and Ice.
- **Index 12**: Electric/Ghost. Useful with Electrocute moves.
- **Index 13**: Water/Rock. Strong against Fire and Grass.
- **Index 14**: Electric/Fight. Good for physical attacks.
- **Index 15**: Ground. But might not be useful if opponent has Ground.
- **Index 16**: Dark/Fight. Useful with Power 114.
- **Index 17**: Normal/Dark. Can handle multiple types.
- **Index 18**: Fairy/Dragon. Similar to index 30.
- **Index 19**: Rock. Strong against Fire and Water.
- **Index 20**: Dragon/Normal. Good for a mix of types.
- **Index 21**: Dark/Ice. Useful if opponent has Normal or Grass.
- **Index 22**: Steel/Flying. Can handle multiple types.
- **Index 23**: Electric/Grass. Good with Light Screen and Reflect.
- **Index 24**: Electric/Water. Similar to index 8.
- **Index 25**: Dragon/Ghost. Good for late-game.
- **Index 26**: Psychic. Similar to index 1.
- **Index 27**: Fire/Fight. Useful for Power moves.
- **Index 28**: Dark/Electric. Can handle multiple types.
- **Index 29**: Poison. Already used?
Wait, the previous team was [30,8,49]. So I can't pick those again unless it's necessary.

So possible candidates are:

Looking for high HP and strong moves.

Indices with higher Max_HP: 0 (152), 2 (151), 19 (148), 36 (151), etc. Maybe choosing one of them could be better.

Also, considering the last result: The team lost, so maybe the opponent had strong Pokémon that were hard to handle. So picking a resilient team with high HP and strong moves would help.

I think index 0 is Flying/Dragon. It has some powerful moves like Power 101 and Accuracy 0.93. Plus, it has Light Screen which can be helpful. Max_HP is decent too.

Another option is index 2: FLYING/FAIRY with 151 HP, which is one of the highest. Its moves include Power 110 and Force Switch, which can switch types effectively.

Similarly, index 19 is Rock with Max_HP 148. It has strong moves against Fire and Water.

Index 36: FLYING with high power moves like Power 114, but lower HP (151). Wait, same as others.

Wait, let me see the previous team was [30,8,49]. So I can't use those again unless necessary.

I think choosing index 0, which is 0, along with two strong others. Maybe 2 and 19.

Alternatively, maybe including a Ghost type for late-game switches or resistances.

But considering that the last result was a loss, perhaps adding more versatile Pokémon to adapt better to different opponents would be good.

Hmm. It's a bit tricky, but I think focusing on high HP, strong moves, and type coverage is key.

Okay, so I need to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster would be the best choice for the next battle. The previous team that won had indices [0, 2, 19], and their Elo is now 1161.92. 

First, I should look at each of those three Pokémon's stats. Let me check:

- Index 0: Type FLYING/DRAGON, Max HP 152.
- Index 2: Type FLYING/FAIRY, Max HP 151.
- Index 19: Type ROCK, Max HP 148.

So these are all Flying or Dragon types with decent HP. They were effective last time and won the battle, so maybe sticking with similar types could be a good strategy.

Now, considering the new roster, I need to choose three Pokémon that can complement each other in terms of type coverage, moves, and overall effectiveness. Since the previous team was successful, perhaps continuing with strong offensive and supportive Pokémon would help.

Looking through the roster, I should look for Pokémon that have strong stats, good attacking moves, and maybe some defensive or supportive abilities to bolster the team's performance.

Let me go through each candidate:

- Index 14: Type ELECTRIC/FIGHT, Max HP 110. This seems like a solid choice because Electric can deal with multiple types effectively, and FIGHT is a versatile type that covers many defensive needs.
  
- Index 30: Type FAIRY/DRAGON, Max HP 124. Fairy is good against Dragon, and having both types could provide excellent coverage against various opponents.
  
- Index 49: Type FLYING, Max HP 136. Flying can switch out effectively, dealing with different types like Ground and Rock.

These three types (Electric/Fight, Fairy/Dragon, and Flying) cover a wide range of offensive capabilities and type advantages. Plus, each has decent Max HP, which is important for staying alive in battles. 

I should also consider their movesets. For example, the Electric/FIGHT Pokémon might have moves that support the team, like Protect or other status moves, which can be useful in protecting the team.

Another thing to look at is how these Pokémon perform against each other's types. Fairy and Dragon are strong against each other, so having both could create a synergy where they can take each other down while supporting each other's weaknesses.

Overall, choosing 14, 30, and 49 seems like a balanced and powerful team that can handle various opponents effectively.

Okay, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their previous success. The last time they played, their team won with Elo 1173.68 and used the indices [0, 2, 19]. Now, their new team is [14, 30, 49], but maybe those weren't the best choices this time.

First, I should look at what each Pokémon in the previous team did. The user provided a list of all the Pokémon templates from 0 to 49. Let me check each one:

- **Pkm 0**: FLYING/DRAGON with decent moves and stats.
- **Pkm 2**: FLYING/FAIRY, also good stats and some useful moves like Light Screen.
- **Pkm 19**: ROCK type, which is a solid choice for physical attacks and coverage.

But their new team uses 14 (ELECTRIC/FIGHT), 30 (FAIRY/DRAGON), and 49 (FLYING). I need to see if these are better than the previous team or not. Maybe they have better moves or synergy.

Looking at each Pokémon in the new team:

- **Pkm 14**: ELECTRIC/FIGHT with moves like MISTY TERRAIN, which can boost Electric attacks. That's good for support.
- **Pkm 30**: FAIRY/DRAGON with moves like Force Switch and Light Screen, which can switch types effectively and provide coverage.
- **Pkm 49**: FLYING with Light Screen and other useful abilities.

I should compare their stats and move sets to see if they are strong individually and together. Maybe the new team has better defensive or offensive capabilities than the previous one.

Also, considering the user's success before, maybe the new team needs more synergy or better coverage for the current meta. I'll have to evaluate each Pokémon's type, moves, and how they can complement each other in battle.

Alright, so I need to figure out a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The last battle was won, and my Elo is now 1186.42. The previous team that won used indices [0, 2, 19]. Then in the next battle, they used [14, 30, 49], which also won. Now, I need to choose a new team of three Pokémon from the roster provided.

First, I should look at the Roster details. Each Pokémon has a Type, Max_HP, and various Moves with their effects. The goal is to pick three that will maximize chances in the next battle, considering past successes.

The previous successful teams used indices 0, 2, 19 and then 14, 30, 49. Let me check what those are:

- 0: Type FLYING/DRAGON with some moves.
- 2: Type FLYING/FAIRY with a variety of moves including Power and Special attacks.
- 19: Type ROCK with high Max_HP and moves like Bug and Dark.

The next team was [14, 30, 49]:

- 14: Type ELECTRIC/FIGHT with decent stats.
- 30: Type FLYING/DRAGON with good moves, especially Flying for coverage.
- 49: Type FLYING with some strong moves.

So the previous successful teams included Rock (19) and multiple Flying types. Maybe there's a pattern of using Rock for physical attackers and Flying for coverage.

Looking at the new Roster, I need to pick three that can complement each other. Let me think about the strengths:

- Type coverage: Having different types like Rock, Fire, Grass, or Psychic can be beneficial.
- High Max_HP: More HP means better survival in battles.
- Effective moves: Moves that have high Power, Accuracy, or are Special to cover multiple weaknesses.

I should avoid Pokémon with too low Max_HP because they might not survive long. Also, considering the types, maybe having a mix of physical attackers and Special attackers would be good.

Looking at the Roster:

- 35 is Type FIGHT with high Max_HP (158) and strong moves.
- 41 is Type FLYING/FIRE with decent stats and some powerful moves.
- 49 is already used in the previous team, but I think it's still viable as a strong Flying type.

Alternatively, maybe including a Rock type would add more versatility. Let me check:

- 19 is Rock with high Max_HP (148) and useful moves like Bug and Dark.
- 35 is FIGHT with good stats.
- 41 or 49 for Flying coverage.

Another consideration is the combination of types that are strong against each other's weaknesses. For example, Ground vs. Electric, Fire vs. Water, etc., but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Looking at the last successful team [14,30,49], they included an Electric/Fight, a Flying/Dragon, and another Flying. Maybe sticking with similar types could work again. However, to ensure variety, perhaps adding a Rock would help in case of physical attacks.

Alternatively, maybe using a combination of FIGHT, FLYING, and another Type like Psychic or Dark could be effective.

Wait, let me think about the moves each Pokémon has:

- 35: FIGHT type with strong moves like Power 135 and Disable.
- 41: FLYING/FIRE with good Accuracy and Power.
- 49: FLYING with multiple powerful Special moves.

Including 35 (FIGHT) would add a strong physical attacker. Including two Flyings could provide both coverage and Special attacks. But maybe adding a third type for coverage, like Rock.

Alternatively, if I go with three different types, that might be more balanced.

But considering the previous team used three Flyings, it worked well. Maybe sticking with that approach is safe.

Another angle: looking at the Elo increase. Since the last result was a win, perhaps keeping the same structure would help maintain success.

Wait, but I need to choose exactly three indices. Let me see which other Pokémon could be strong additions.

Looking through the Roster:

- 35 (FIGHT) seems like a solid choice with high Max_HP and useful moves.
- 41 (FLYING/FIRE) has good stats and powerful moves.
- 49 (FLYING) is another strong addition.

Alternatively, maybe including a Psychic type could help in future battles, but I'm not sure if it's necessary here.

I also need to consider that the previous team used [14,30,49], which are all Flyings except for 14. So maybe adding a FIGHT and a Rock would add more versatility without sacrificing too much.

But perhaps it's better to stick with what worked before, but mix in one of the strong non-Flying types.

Wait, let me check the Max_HP:

- 35: 158
- 41: 158
- 49: 136

So they all have decent HP. Maybe adding a FIGHT would provide a strong physical attacker without relying solely on Flying.

Alternatively, maybe including a Dark type could help with resistances or boosts.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to make an educated guess based on past success and current Roster.

I think choosing 35 (FIGHT), 41 (FLYING/FIRE), and 49 (FLYING) would be a good mix, adding both physical and Special attack coverage with high HP.

So the indices are 35, 41, 49. Wait, but I need to return them as ---i1, i2, i3---.

Wait no, the user's last team was [14,30,49], which is three Flyings. So maybe keeping two Flyings and adding another strong Pokémon.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing 35 (FIGHT), 41 (FLYING/FIRE), and 49 (FLYING) would be better than just using the same types again.

But I'm not entirely sure if that's optimal. Maybe it's safer to stick with what worked before, but I'm supposed to choose optimally based on Roster and previous success.

Alternatively, looking at other strong Pokémon:

- 17: Normal/Dark
- 34: Grass
- 35: Fight
- 36: Flying
- etc.

But without more context, it's hard to know. Maybe choosing the highest HPs would be better, but some have lower HP and higher attack power.

Wait, maybe considering that the previous team had three Flyings, which were 14 (Electric/Fight), 30 (Fairly/Dragn), and 49 (Fly). So perhaps adding a strong Fighting type again could help in case of physical attacks.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to add another Electric or Psychic for coverage. But I'm not sure.

I think the best approach is to include at least one Fighting type, as they are strong physically. So including 35 (FIGHT) would be good. Then two Flyings, like 41 and 49, or others.

So perhaps choosing 35, 41, 49 as the new team.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what Pokémon team to use next based on the information provided. The user mentioned that their last team won with an Elo of 1200.25. The previous team used indices [35, 41, 49]. Now, I need to select a new team from the given roster.

First, let me look at the types of the previous team. Indexes 35, 41, and 49 correspond to PkmTemplates:

- 35: Type FIGHT
- 41: Type FLYING/FIRE
- 49: Type FLYING

So, the last team had two Flying-type Pokémon (indices 41 and 49) and one FIGHT-type Pokémon at index 35.

Now, considering the previous battle where they won, I should think about what types are strong against their opponents or have good moves. But since I don't know the exact opponent types from before, maybe it's better to look for Pokémon that can cover multiple types effectively and have high Max HP for durability.

Looking at the roster, I need to choose three Pokémon from the given indices. Let me go through each index and see their strengths:

- Index 0: FLYING/DRAGON – High Max HP (152), has moves like Bug, Power 101, etc.
- Index 1: PSYCHIC – Good for Psychic terrain, has Normal and other moves.
- Index 2: FLYING/FAIRY – High Max HP (151), Fairy type with useful moves.
- Index 3: POISON – Good at poisoning opponents.
- Index 4: DARK/FIRE – Fire/Dark types, can be good for offensive roles.
- Index 5: FAIRY/ROCK – Rock/Fairy mix, can be solid defensively and offensively.
- Index 6: BUG/WATER – Water/Bug types with good moves like Light Screen.
- Index 7: DARK – Good for Dark moves, decent Max HP.
- Index 8: STEEL/GHOST – Steel/Ghost types, strong in combat.
- Index 9: GHOST/ICE – Ice/Ghost, useful for defensive and offensive moves.
- Index 10: GHOST/DARK – Ghost/Dark, good for late-game strategies.
- Index 11: WATER/PSYCHIC – Water/Psychic, which can be strong against certain types.
- Index 12: ELECTRIC/GHOST – Electric/Ghost, good for both offensive and defensive roles.
- Index 13: WATER/ROCK – Rock/Water, versatile in terrain and type coverage.
- Index 14: ELECTRIC/FIGHT – Electric/Fight, useful for both offense and defense.
- Index 15: GROUND – Ground type with high Max HP (108).
- Index 16: DARK/FIGHT – Dark/Fight, strong in combat with good moves.
- Index 17: NORMAL/DARK – Normal/Dark, good all-rounder with decent stats.
- Index 18: FAIRY/DRAGON – Fairy/Dragon, can be both offensive and defensive.
- Index 19: ROCK – Rock type, great for physical attacks.
- Index 20: NORMAL/DRAGON – Normal/Dragon, versatile.
- Index 21: DARK/ICE – Dark/Ice, good for both offense and defense.
- Index 22: FLYING/STEEL – Steel/Flying, strong against many types.
- Index 23: ELECTRIC/GRASS – Electric/Grass, good with grassy terrain.
- Index 24: ELECTRIC/WATER – Electric/Water, strong in both offensive and defensive.
- Index 25: DRAGON/GHOST – Dragon/Ghost, useful for both.
- Index 26: PSYCHIC – Solid Psychic type.
- Index 27: FIRE/FIGHT – Fire/Fight, good offense with high Max HP.
- Index 28: DARK/ELECTRIC – Dark/Electric, versatile and strong in combat.
- Index 29: POISON – Strong poison moves, can be very effective.
- Index 30: FAIRY/DRAGON – Fairy/Dragon, similar to index 2 but a bit lower Max HP.
- Index 31: PSYCHIC/WATER – Psychic/Water, good for specific terrain.
- Index 32: DRAGON – Dragon type with solid moves.
- Index 33: ELECTRIC – Electric type with decent stats.
- Index 34: GRASS – Grass type with some offensive power.
- Index 35: FIGHT – Fight type, same as index 35 in the previous team.
- Index 36: FLYING – Flying type, similar to others but a bit lower Max HP.
- Index 37: FLYING – Another Flying type, perhaps better than some.
- Index 38: DARK/GROUND – Dark/Ground, strong in both offense and defense.
- Index 39: FIGHT/GRASS – Fight/Grass, good for both types with solid stats.
- Index 40: ICE – Ice type, useful for defensive moves like reflect.
- Index 41: FLYING/FIRE – Same as index 49 but a bit lower Max HP.
- Index 42: GROUND/FLYING – Ground/Flying, versatile and strong against many types.
- Index 43: NORMAL/FIRE – Normal/Fire, good for both types with decent moves.
- Index 44: PSYCHIC/GRASS – Psychic/Grass, good for specific terrain.
- Index 45: FAIRY – Fairy type, similar to others but lower Max HP.
- Index 46: FIRE – Fire type, solid stats.
- Index 47: FIGHT/STEEL – Fight/Steel, strong in both offense and defense.
- Index 48: FIGHT – Another Fight type, slightly higher Max HP than previous team.
- Index 49: FLYING – Similar to others but a bit lower.

Now, given that the last battle was won with ELO of 1200.25 and the previous winning teams were:
[0,2,19], [14,30,49], [35,41,49]
The task is to choose a new team from the Roster (all templates are available) that can maximize your chances in the next battle.

So first, let's think about what makes a good Pokémon team for a battle. Usually, teams are built around type coverage, move coverage, and individual Pokémon stats. Since this is a simplified version, perhaps we need to focus on the types that are strong against others or have powerful moves.

Looking at previous winning teams:
First was [0,2,19]. Let's check those:
- 0: Type FLYING/DRAGON. Flying has good coverage.
- 2: FLYING/FAIRY. Good for fairy type.
- 19: ROCK. Rock is strong against many types.

Second team: [14,30,49]
- 14: ELECTRIC/FIGHT. Electric can be strong, and Fight is versatile.
- 30: FAIRY/DRAGON. Fairy and dragon have good offensive options.
- 49: FLYING. Good for coverage.

Third team: [35,41,49]
- 35: FIGHT. Strong physical attacker.
- 41: FLYING/FIRE. Fire is strong against grass and water.
- 49: FLYING. Good all-rounder.

So previous winners have included Rock (index 19), Electric/Fight, Fairy/Dragon, and multiple Flyings.

Given that the last team won, perhaps the strategy is to continue using strong type combinations and high Max HP for survivability.

Looking at the current Roster:

We need to pick three Pokémon that can cover multiple types and have strong moves. Let's look for types that are strong against others or have powerful multi-type coverage.

Flyers are always good because they resist Ground, have access to strong physical attacks, and can cover a lot of types. Fairy is also strong against Dark and Dragon. Rock is good against many types. Electric is strong against Water and Ground. Fire is strong against Grass and Water.

Looking at the available Pokémon:

- 35: FIGHT. High Max HP and solid physical moves.
- 41: FLYING/FIRE. Good for both Fire (which counters Grass and Water) and Flying, which covers a lot.
- 49: FLYING. Another strong all-rounder.

Alternatively, could we use another type like Electric? For example, 14 is Electric/Fight but he might already be in the previous team.

Wait, the last result was ELO 1200.25 and the previous teams were [35,41,49]. So those indices are still valid unless they have been used before. But the instruction says we can choose any from the Roster as long as it's not previously used in this call? Wait no, each time you get a new team to pick, you just choose three from the Roster regardless of prior usage.

Wait no, actually the problem says: "using only that info, choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster that will maximize your chances in the next battle."

So previous results don't restrict the current choice beyond what's given. So we can pick any three as long as they are in the Roster.

But looking at the indices provided: The last winning teams included 35,41,49. So maybe picking similar types again would be good.

Looking for high Max HP, strong moves, and type coverage.

Another approach is to see which Pokémon have high Max HP:

Looking through the list:
- 0:152
-1:89
-2:151
-3:55
-4:61
-5:82
-6:109
-7:92
-8:160
-9:136
-10:139
-11:106
-12:131
-13:138
-14:110
-15:108
-16:125
-17:119
-18:75
-19:148
-20:102
-21:134
-22:104
-23:131
-24:115
-25:116
-26:106
-27:116
-28:74
-29:160
-30:124
-31:84
-32:94
-33:112
-34:124
-35:158
-36:151
-37:135
-38:107
-39:112
-40:150
-41:158
-42:157
-43:139
-44:160
-45:73
-46:92
-47:126
-48:142
-49:136

So high HP are 0,8,9,29,35, etc.

But the problem is not just about surviving but also about dealing damage. So we need to look at their moves and types.

Looking for strong moves:

For example, Electric/Fight (14) has STun Tailwind, which can boost your team's effectiveness.

Or Pkm 8: Steel/Ghost with Protect and Light Screen, which are good defensive moves.

But the last result was a win, so perhaps we want offensive strength this time.

Looking at FIGHT type, like 35: FIGHT, Max HP 158, has POISON, Reflect, etc. So that's solid.

FLYING/FIRE (41): High HP, strong Fire attacks which are good against Grass and Water types.

FLYING (49): Also high HP, with Light Screen to protect allies.

Alternatively, maybe a mix of types: Electric, Fighting, Flying.

Wait, but the indices given are [35,41,49], so perhaps those have been used before. But no, in this problem, each call is independent. The previous team was [14,30,49]. So 35,41,49 are not in that list, but in another.

But the user's last result was a win with Elo 1200, and their prior teams include [0,2,19], [14,30,49], etc.

Wait no: "Winning team indexes in past matches: [0, 2, 19] [14, 30, 49] [35, 41, 49]."

So they have used those combinations before. So perhaps the previous teams had different compositions. Now they need to pick a new one.

To maximize chances, we should choose a team that can cover multiple types and has strong offensive moves.

Looking at available indices not in the previous:

Wait no, the instruction says to use only the given info, which includes the last result and the Roster. So regardless of past usage, we need to pick the best possible team now.

So perhaps pick three Pokémon with good coverage, high HP, and strong moves.

Looking for types that can counter each other's weaknesses.

For example:

- Electric (can be countered by Ground)
- Rock (countered by Water)
- Ice (countered by Fire)

But not sure about the exact counters here.

Alternatively, choosing a mix of types like Electric/Fight, Flying/Fire, and maybe a Ghost/Dark for coverage.

Wait, looking at the Roster:

Pkm 8: Steel/Ghost with Light Screen and Protect.

Pkm 35: Fight, which is good against Ghost and Dark.

Pkm 41: Flying/Fire, which can handle Grass and Water.

So combining these might be effective.

Alternatively, maybe Pkm 14 (Electric/Fight), Pkm 30 (Fair/Dragon with some boosts), and Pkm 49 (Flying).

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps picking 35,41,49 is a good combination because they are strong fighters.

Wait, let's look at their stats:

Pkm 35: Type FIGHT

Moves include POISON, Reflect, etc. High HP.

Pkm 41: Type FLYING/FIRE. Moves include WATER and ICE, so can handle those types.

Pkm 49: Type FLYING. Good moves with Light Screen and some boosts.

So that's a good team, maybe.

Alternatively, Pkm 0 is Flying/Dragon, which could be useful against certain types.

But given the last result was a win, perhaps they need to diversify.

Wait, but the problem says that each time you have to pick from Roster based only on previous info and Roster. So I think in this case, the best choice would be 35,41,49 because they are high HP and have strong moves.

Okay, so I need to figure out what Pokémon team to choose next based on the information given. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

First, the user provided a list of 50 Pokémon templates with their types, Max HP, and moves. The task is to select three indices from this roster to form a new team that maximizes the chances of winning the next battle. 

The previous team used was [35, 41, 49], and the last result was a win, which increased the Elo rating to 1215.28. So, I need to consider what made those Pokémon effective and what might complement them or improve upon their weaknesses.

Looking at each Pokémon's type and moves can give insights into their strengths and vulnerabilities. For example:

- **35**: Type FIGHT, Max HP 158. It has moves like Poison, Power 73, Accuracy 0.78. It also has Reflect which could help in protecting the team.
- **41**: Type FLYING/FIRE, Max HP 158. It has Water, Ice, and Fire moves, which are versatile. High accuracy and power could be assets.
- **49**: Type FLYING, Max HP 136. It has Psychic, Power 76, Accuracy 0.87. Also, it can switch types, which is useful in different situations.

The previous team likely performed well because of their high HP, accurate moves, and a mix of types that cover offensive and defensive needs. So, the new team should aim for similar traits but maybe with different types or more synergy.

Now, looking at other Pokémon:

- **0**: FLYING/DRAGON: High Max HP, good accuracy, multi-type which can help against various opponents.
- **2**: FLYING/FAIRY: High Max HP, fairy moves, which are strong against dragon and ice types. It also has Light Screen, which is useful for protecting the team.
- **19**: ROCK: Good physical attacks, but maybe not as versatile as others. It can help with rock-based strategies.

Comparing these to the previous team, I need to see if their types complement each other or provide coverage against common Pokémon types. For instance, having a Rock type could help against Fighting and Ground types, which are common in many teams.

I also need to consider the moves each Pokémon has. High accuracy and powerful moves can contribute to the team's overall effectiveness. Also, defensive moves like Reflect or Light Screen from certain templates (like 0 and 2) can be beneficial.

Another consideration is the Max HP; higher HP means better survivability, which is crucial in battles. The previous team had high HP, so maintaining that would be good.

Looking at **0**, it has a Dragon/ Flying type with high HP and accurate moves, including Special attacks. It also has Light Screen, which can help protect allies. Its multi-type makes it versatile.

**2**: Fairy/Flying is another strong option. It's resistant to dragon and ice types, which are common in the roster. Plus, its fairy moves can be effective against certain opponents, and it has a high Max HP of 151.

**19**: Rock type is good for physical attacks and breaking through defenses. It might not have as high HP as others but could provide strong offensive support.

Alternatively, considering **14**: Electric/Fight, which has high Power and some good moves like Thunder Shock or Ice Beam (if applicable). But I'm not sure about its Max HP compared to others.

So, putting it all together, the new team should include Pokémon that are strong offensively, have good defensive moves, high accuracy, and types that cover a range of possibilities. The previous team used 35,41,49, which were FIGHT, FLYING/FIRE, FLYING. Maybe adding another type like Rock or Dragon would provide more versatility.

Looking at the options again:

- **0**: Dragon/Flying: Multi-type, high HP, accurate.
- **2**: Fairy/Flying: High HP, fairy moves, Light Screen.
- **19**: Rock: Strong physical attacks, good for breaking through.

This combination seems strong because:

1. Both 0 and 2 are FLYING types with high Max HP and useful defensive/protective moves (Light Screen).
2. Dragon type can counter Fairy and Ice types, which might be common in opponents.
3. Rock type provides strong physical attacks and can help against Ground or Rock-weak opponents.

Alternatively, maybe including a Dark or Ghost type for better coverage against certain Pokémon, but I don't see any immediately that fit as well as 0,2,19.

So, the new team would be [0,2,19]. Let me double-check their types and moves to ensure they can complement each other and handle various opponents effectively.

Okay, I need to figure out the best Pokémon team from the given roster based on the previous battle results. The last result was a win with Elo 1231.59, and the winning team used indices [0, 2, 19]. 

First, I should analyze what each of these Pokémon brings to the table. Let's start by looking at their types, movesets, and stats.

Pokémon 0 is Type FLYING/DRAGON with Max_HP 152. Its moves include Bug and Special attacks, which can be useful for coverage. It also has a good HP, so it's likely a solid choice.

Pokémon 2 is FLYING/FAIRY, Max_HP 151. This Pokémon has strong Fairly-type moves and some boosts. It seems like a powerful attacker with good support moves.

Pokémon 19 is ROCK type, Max_HP 148. Rock types are generally good for defensive purposes, especially against Ground and Rock opponents. It also has some useful moves like Target Boosts, which can enhance the team's effectiveness.

Now, looking at the current Roster, I need to choose three Pokémon that complement each other in terms of types, coverage, and stats. The previous team used [0, 2, 19], so maybe sticking with similar types would be beneficial for consistency and synergy.

I should check if there are other strong Rock-type Pokémon available, as they can help against Ground opponents and provide valuable defensive boosts. Also, Flying and Fairy types are great for offensive roles, offering both neutral and special attacks.

Looking through the roster, I see that indices 14 is Electric/Fight, which could pair well with Rock for type coverage. However, since the previous team used a Rock, maybe adding another strong attacker would be better.

Another consideration is the moveset of each Pokémon. For example, if a team has multiple Special attackers, it can be effective in multi-type battles. Also, having a mix of physical and special attacks can help against different opponents.

I should also think about their Accuracy and PP (Power Points). Higher accuracy and longer PP are better for sustained damage output. Additionally, considering the previous battle's outcome, maybe the team needs more defensive or supportive Pokémon to ensure survival in future battles.

Wait, but the last result was a win, so maybe focusing on offensive strength again would be good. However, it's also important to have a balance between offense and defense.

Looking back, the previous team had two Flying types (0 and 2) which is a lot of aerial coverage. Adding another strong attacker with a different type could help in versatility. Maybe someone from index 14 or 30?

Wait, no, maybe it's better to stick with similar effective types for consistency. The last successful team used Rock, so perhaps including another Rock or Ground type would be beneficial.

But looking at the available options, I need to pick three that can complement each other. Maybe a mix of Rock, Flying, and Fairy.

Wait, but in the previous selection [0,2,19], they have two Flying types and one Rock. So maybe for this new team, we should aim for similar roles: perhaps another Rock, a strong Flying or Fairy attacker, and a support or boost Pokémon.

Alternatively, considering that the last battle was won, perhaps the team can include high damage dealers with good movesets.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me list out the possible candidates:

From the Roster, some strong options are:

- 0: Flying/Dragon – strong attacker
- 2: Flying/Fairy – strong fairy type with boosts
- 19: Rock – solid defensive type with target boost

But maybe I can find another Rock or Ground to add more coverage. Alternatively, adding a Dark or Ghost could be useful for specific resistances.

Wait, the user's previous selection was [0,2,19], which worked well. So perhaps maintaining that trio is the best option if it's still effective.

But the problem says "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster that will maximize your chances in the next battle." So maybe trying to find another set that can cover different types or have better stats.

Alternatively, looking for Pokémon with higher Max_HP and more powerful movesets. For example, checking if any index has higher HP than 148 (like 35: FIGHT with Max_HP 158) could be a better choice.

But I also need to consider the types and how they synergize. Maybe having a Rock type for defense, a strong Special attacker, and another type that covers multiple weaknesses.

Wait, considering the last result was a win, perhaps the previous team can be tweaked slightly but remains mostly effective.

Alternatively, maybe including more Fairy or Dragon types for added effectiveness against certain opponents.

I think I need to compare each candidate's stats and moves. For example, Pokémon 0 has a strong Bug move which is useful, but maybe other types have better coverage.

Wait, perhaps it's best to stick with the previous winning indices because they worked before. So [0,2,19] might be the way to go again unless there's an obvious reason not to.

But the user says "maximize your chances in the next battle." If the team has won before, maybe keeping that same composition is optimal for consistency.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a new Pokémon with better coverage or higher stats could improve the team. For example, checking if index 35 (FIGHT) with Max_HP 158 is available and how it synergizes with others.

But without knowing the specific rules of battle, it's hard to judge. However, the problem says to use only the given info: previous team indices and last result. So perhaps considering that the last team won, maybe sticking with similar types would be best.

Wait, the last result was "Your last team won." So the new team should aim to have similar strengths. The previous team used [0,2,19], which are all strong attackers with good Max_HP and moves.

Looking at the Roster, perhaps selecting another set of high HP templates that can cover different types effectively.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Pokémon with specific resistances or boosts to counter common weaknesses.

But without more info on what the opponents are, it's hard. So perhaps the best approach is to pick the next three highest Max_HP Pokémon that have strong movesets.

Looking through the Roster:

- 0: HP 152
- 2: HP 151
- 19: HP 148

Then other high HPs include 8 (160), 34 (124), etc. But maybe selecting based on type coverage is better.

Alternatively, perhaps picking Pokémon with strong multi-type which can cover multiple weaknesses.

But considering it's a new battle, and the last team won, sticking to what worked before might be safest.

So perhaps choosing [0,2,19] again as they have good stats and movesets.

Wait, but the problem says "choose a new 3-Pokémon team", implying it's a different one from previous. Or does it allow repeats?

Looking back at the instructions: It just says to choose a new team from the Roster. So can include same indices as before unless specified otherwise.

But in the example, the user shows previous teams and then asks for a new one. But no explicit rule against reusing indices.

So perhaps it's allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the AI should find the best possible team regardless of past selections.

Given that, I might need to compute which three-Pokémon combination has the highest chance based on their stats and move sets.

But without specific battle mechanics, it's hard. So perhaps selecting the top three by Max_HP or some other metric.

Alternatively, looking for Pokémon with strong multi-type abilities that can cover various weaknesses.

Wait, but since I don't have access to actual battle simulations, maybe selecting a team that includes types known for high damage or resistance.

But this is getting too vague. Maybe the best approach is to choose the top three based on Max_HP:

Looking through the Roster, the highest HPs are 8 (160), 34 (124), and 2 (151). So perhaps [8,34,2].

But I'm not sure if that's the optimal choice.

Alternatively, perhaps selecting a team with strong multi-type abilities to cover different attack types.

Looking at the Roster:

- PkmTemplate 0: FLYING/DRAGON
- PkmTemplate 2: FLYING/FAIRY
- PkmTemplate19: ROCK

These are all strong offensive types. Maybe they can cover each other's weaknesses.

Alternatively, maybe including a Ghost or Dark type for coverage against certain attacks.

Looking at PkmTemplate17 and others.

But without knowing the specifics of what the opponents are, it's hard to determine.

So perhaps the best approach is to pick the top three highest HP Pokémon that have strong move sets.

Looking through:

- 0: HP 152, good moves
- 2: HP 151, strong fairy moves
- 19: HP 148, rock type with strong bug and dark moves

Alternatively, maybe include a Steel type for defense.

But without knowing the specifics of what's needed, it's challenging. So perhaps selecting based on Max HP is safer.

Thus, choosing [0,2,19] as they have high HP and good move sets.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which three Pokémon from this roster would give me the best chance of winning the next battle. It's my first time, and there's no prior result, so I need to start fresh.

First, I'll look at the types available in the Roster. The goal is to choose a team that can effectively counter different types, but since it's my first battle, maybe having a balanced type coverage would be good. Let me list out the types:

- Psychic/Ghost
- Fire/Rock
- Fire/Dragon
- Electric/Bug
- Electric/Rock
- Ice/Water
- Steel
- Ghost
- Psychics
- Ghost
- Dragon/Ice
- Ice
- Rock/Normal
- Fire
- Dark
- Bug/Drake
- Water/Ghost
- Dragon/Ground
- Grass/Fire
- Rock/Normal
- Normal/Flying
- Bug/Drake
- Fairy
- Steel
- Steel/Fight
- Fairy/Ghost
- Steel/Fight
- Fairy
- Rock/Steel
- Grass
- Grass
- Dark/Grass
- Fight
- Dark
- Rock/Normal
- Water
- Poison/Water
- FIGHT
- Dark
- Rock
- GRASS
- Ghost
- Dragon/Ground
- Grass/Fire
- Rock/Normal
- Rock
- Fairy
- Steel
- Steel
- Rock/Steel
- Grass
- Rock/Normal
- Water/Ghost
- Dragon/Rock
- Flying

Hmm, that's a lot. I think I need to focus on types that are strong against each other and have high Max HP for survivability.

Looking at the indices:

0: Psychic/Ghost - High HP, good moves.
1: Fire/Rock - Decent HP, decent moves.
2: Fire/Drake - Lower HP than others? Let me check. Max_HP is 118. Not too bad.
3: Electric/Bug - 98 HP, maybe a bit on the lower side.
4: Electric/Rock - 137 HP, which is decent.
5: Ice/Water - 136 HP, strong.
6: Steel - 69 HP, quite low.
7: Ice - 105 HP, okay.
8: Dark - 58 HP, very low.
9: Ghost - 138 HP, good.
10: Psychics - 128 HP, solid.
11: Ghost - 125 HP, decent.
12: Water - 83 HP, lower.
13: Ghost - 160 HP, that's a high HP, so this could be a tank.
14: Ice - 147 HP, very strong.
15: Flying/Normal - 120 HP, good.
16: Dark/Grass - 138 HP, decent.
17: Bug/Drake - 98 HP, similar to others.
18: Psychics/Fire - 160 HP, another tank.
19: Poison/Fire - 118 HP, okay.
20: Draken/Toxic - 143 HP, solid.
21: Normal/Flying - 134 HP, nice.
22: Rock - 109 HP, decent.
23: Fire - 129 HP, decent.
24: Psychics/Ghost - 91 HP, lower than some others.
25: Normal - 41 HP, very low, probably not a good choice for the front lines.
26: Fairy - 124 HP, solid.
27: Steel - 119 HP, okay.
28: Grass - 148 HP, high, good.
29: Psychics - 95 HP, decent.
30: Fire/Ground - 77 HP, lower, but maybe useful for type coverage.
31: Rock/Normal - 98 HP, similar to others.
32: Bug/Drake - 90 HP, same as above.
33: Flying/Water - 129 HP, decent.
34: Poison/Water - 135 HP, solid.
35: Fight - 114 HP, okay.
36: Dark - 136 HP, decent.
37: Grass - 50 HP, very low.
38: Water/Ghost - 95 HP, similar to others.
39: Draken/Ground - 106 HP, decent.
40: Grass/Fire - 128 HP, solid.
41: Rock - 160 HP, another tank.
42: Fairy/Ghost - 98 HP, decent.
43: Steel/Fight - 119 HP, okay.
44: Fairy - 112 HP, decent.
45: Steel - 160 HP, same as others.
46: Rock/Steel - 160 HP, same.
47: Grass - 98 HP, similar.
48: Draken/Rock - 126 HP, solid.
49: Flying - 121 HP, decent.

So, the highest HP is 160 for indices 13 (Ghost), 18 (Psychics/Fire), 20 (Draken/Toxic), 41 (Rock), 45 (Steel), 46 (Rock/Steel), and 48 (Draken/Rock). These all have high health which is good for taking hits.

Next, I should consider the types that are strong against each other. For example, Fire vs. Water, Electric vs. Ground, etc. But since it's my first battle, maybe focusing on a balanced team with types that can handle various threats.

Looking at the moves, some have powerful attacks or good accuracy. For example, index 14 (Ice) has Normal type with high Power and Accuracy. Index 13 (Ghost) has Dragon move which is strong against Dark types. Maybe having a Ghost/Dark type could be useful for dealing with certain opponents.

I also notice that some Pokémon have moves like Trickroom or Reflect, which can change the battle flow. For example, index 4 (Electric/Rock) has both Electric and Rock moves, which are versatile.

Another thing to consider is the combination of types. If I pick a Fire type, it would be good to have a Water type to counter it. Similarly, Electric and Ground would work well together since Electric is strong against Ground.

Looking at the indices:

- 14 (Ice) has Ice type, which is neutral but can cover some moves.
- 13 (Ghost) could cover Ghost types, which are useful for certain opponents.
- 18 (Psychics/Fire) would be a good Fire type with Psychics, which can handle Ghosts and others.

Alternatively, maybe a combination of Electric/Rock, Ice/Water, and something else. For example:

- 4: Electric/Rock
- 5: Ice/Water
- 14: Ice

But I need to check if these are available as separate indices or if they're part of the same template. Wait, no, each index is a separate Pokémon.

So perhaps choosing 13 (Ghost), 4 (Electric/Rock), and 48 (Draken/Rock). But Draken/Rock might have Dragon moves which could be useful against certain types like Dark or Ice.

Wait, but if I'm going for type coverage, maybe Electric (for Ground) and Rock (for multiple types) are good. Also, Ghost can handle Psychic and Ground types.

Another thought: If I choose a Fire type, Water would counter it. But in this case, I don't have a Water type in the top indices. Maybe 5 (Ice/Water), but Ice isn't as strong against Fire as Water is. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe choosing Electric/Rock, Ghost, and something else like Steel. For example, 4 (Electric/Rock), 13 (Ghost), and 27 (Steel). Steel would handle Rock and other types.

Wait, but the user wants three indices. Let me try to think of a team that can handle multiple types:

- Electric/Rock: covers Electric and Rock moves.
- Ghost: good against Psychic and Ground.
- Ice: useful for Water and Grass, plus some powerful moves.

So perhaps 4 (Electric/Rock), 13 (Ghost), and 14 (Ice). Alternatively, 48 (Draken/Rock) which has Dragon and Rock, which might be better against certain opponents.

But I need to make sure the team is balanced. Let me check their Max HP: all around 100-160, so they can take hits.

Another angle: if I pick templates with high PP moves that can hit multiple types. For example, index 14 (Ice) has Normal move which can hit Ice, Rock, etc., and also a Dragon move which is strong against Dark.

I think the best approach is to select three Pokémon that have versatile types and strong moves, covering different weaknesses. Maybe:

- Electric/Rock (4): covers Electric and Rock.
- Ghost/PSYCHIC (13 or 24): for Psychic resistance and Ground weakness.
- Ice (14): covers Ice and Water.

But wait, I need to choose indices. Let's see: index 4 is Electric/Rock, which includes both types. So that's good for dual type coverage.

Index 13 is Ghost/DRAGON? Wait no, index 13 is Type=Ghost, Max_HP=160, Moves=[DRAGON, Power 140, Accuracy 0.81, Max PP 14, PHYSICAL, Priority 1, FAIRY, Power 103, Accuracy 0.91, Max PP 8, SPECIAL, Priority 1, Probability 0.26, Tailwind, NORMAL, Power 140, Accuracy 0.95, Max PP 11, PHYSICAL, DARK, Power 96, Max PP 9, SPECIAL, Priority 1, Probability 0.31, Trickroom].

So it's a Ghost type with Dragon and Fairy moves.

Alternatively, index 14 is Ice/?? Wait no, index 14 is Type=ICE, so it's pure Ice.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Each index corresponds to a Pokémon with its own Type(s) and Moves.

So, for example, index 4: Type=ELECTRIC/ROCK. So that Pokémon is both Electric and Rock types.

Similarly, index 13: Type=GHOST, so it's pure Ghost.

Therefore, choosing Electric/Rock (4), Ghost (13), and Ice (14).

This team would have:

- Electric/Rock (covers Electric and Rock moves)
- Ghost (good against Psychic and Ground)
- Ice (good against Water and Grass)

It seems balanced. Alternatively, if I choose Electric/Rock, then maybe another dual type like Fire/Ground or something else.

Wait, but index 30 is Fire/Ground. So perhaps 4 (Electric/Rock), 13 (Ghost), and 30 (Fire/Ground). But that might be overkill with Fire and Ground, which could clash with Electric's effectiveness against Ground.

Alternatively, maybe go for a more offensive team with higher Power moves.

Looking at index 20: Type=DRAGON/POISON. It has high Power and can handle multiple types.

But I'm not sure if that's better than the earlier choices.

Another idea: Use the highest HP templates to build a strong team. For example, 41 (Rock) with HP 160, 13 (Ghost) with HP 160, and 18 (Psychics/Fire) with HP 160. This would give a strong defensive and offensive team.

But are these types complementary? Rock covers Rock and Ground, Ghost covers Psychic and Ground, Fire covers Fire and Grass. It's more of a coverage team.

Alternatively, if I want to focus on Electric and Water, perhaps choose Electric/Rock (4), Ice (14), and Water/Ghost (38). But 38 is Type=WATER/GHOST, which would complement the others.

Wait, but with three Pokémon, it's hard to have all types covered. So maybe go for a team that can handle multiple typings and has strong moves.

I think I'll settle on Electric/Rock (4), Ghost (13), and Ice (14). They cover Electric, Rock, Ghost, and Ice types, which are useful in various battles.

So the indices would be 4, 13, 14.

Okay, so I need to help choose a new Pokémon team from the given roster. The user has provided a lot of information, including the previous team's indices and their last battle result. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the problem statement: the goal is to select three Pokémon from the Roster such that they maximize chances in the next battle. The user also mentioned that the last result was a win with an Elo update, so we should consider strategies based on that history.

The previous team used indices [4, 13, 14]. Let me check what types those are:

- Index 4: ELECTRIC/ROCK
- Index 13: GHOST
- Index 14: ICE

So the last team had a mix of Electric, Rock, and Ghost/Ice types. Now, to build a new team, I should consider complementing these types or maybe adding strong offensive or defensive Pokémon.

Looking at the Roster:

I need to pick three from 0-49. Let me think about what each index's type is:

Wait, actually, each PkmTemplate has a Type string like "PSYCHIC/GHOST" etc., so I'll have to parse that for each index.

But perhaps instead of going through all, I can focus on the previous team's strengths and see what types might counter them or work well together.

The last team won, which suggests they were effective. So maybe keeping some similar types but adding stronger ones could be good.

Let me list the types of the previous team:

- 4: ELECTRIC/ROCK
- 13: GHOST
- 14: ICE

So their types are Electric, Rock, Ghost, and Ice.

Now, considering counters or complementary types. Maybe adding a Dragon type for versatility, since it can cover multiple types in moves. Also, strong single-type teams might be effective if they have good coverage.

Looking at the available Pokémon:

- Some with high Max_HP: like 13 (160), 4 (137), 14 (147). Maybe keeping one of these could help.
- Types that are currently popular or strong in the meta could be good.

Wait, but maybe I should look for synergy. For example, having a Ghost and Rock can cover both Ground and some other types. Electric is great for offensive moves like Thunderbolt, which can take out many types. Ice is good against Grass and Water.

So perhaps adding another Electric or Ice type would help. Alternatively, maybe adding a Dragon to boost attack or cover multiple types.

Looking at the indices:

Let me think about each index's Type:

0: PSYCHIC/GHOST
1: FIRE/ROCK
2: FIRE/DRAGON
3: ELECTRIC/BUG
4: ELECTRIC/ROCK (used)
5: ICE/WATER
6: STEEL
7: ICE
8: DARK
9: GHOST
10: PSYCHIC
11: GHOST
12: WATER
13: GHOST (used)
14: ICE (used)
15: FLYING/NORMAL
16: DARK/GRASS
17: BUG/DRAGON
18: PSYCHIC/FIRE
19: POISON/FIRE
20: DRAGON/POISON
21: NORMAL/FLYING
22: ROCK
23: FIRE
24: PSYCHIC/GHOST
25: NORMAL
26: FAIRY
27: STEEL
28: GRASS
29: PSYCHIC
30: FIRE/GROUND
31: ROCK/NORMAL
32: BUG/DRAGON
33: FLYING/WATER
34: POISON/WATER
35: FIGHT
36: DARK
37: GRASS
38: WATER/GHOST
39: DRAGON/GROUND
40: GRASS/FIRE
41: ROCK
42: FAIRY/GHOST
43: STEEL/FIGHT
44: FAIRY
45: STEEL
46: ROCK/STEEL
47: GRASS
48: DRAGON/ROCK
49: FLYING

So excluding the previous indices (4,13,14), I have to choose 3 from the remaining.

Looking for strong types that can complement each other or counter common types.

Ghost is already covered by 9 and 11. Electric is in 3. Rock is in 1 and 22 and 41. Ice is in 5 and 7.

Maybe adding a Dragon type (indices 2,17,20,32,39,48) as it's versatile. Or maybe a Steel type (6,27,43,45,46).

Alternatively, strong single-type teams: like Fire, Grass, Water, etc.

Looking at the types with high Max_HP:

13:160
14:147
4:137
Also, 0:145, 6:69, 7:105, 9:138, etc.

But Max_HP alone isn't everything. Need to look at their moves as well.

For example, index 30 is FIRE/GROUND with a strong move set, including Steel and Fire moves which can be effective against many types.

Index 14 is ICE, but it's already used. So maybe 5: ICE/WATER could add another Ice type for coverage.

Alternatively, adding a Dark type (8) or Faerie (26,42).

Wait, but perhaps I should focus on the strengths of the previous team and see what they can counter.

The last team had Electric, Rock, Ghost, and Ice. So their strong points are:

- Electric: great against Flying, Ground, etc.
- Rock: counters many physical attacks and is strong against Grass.
- Ghost: deals with Dark and Poison effectively.
- Ice: counters Water and Grass.

So to counter that, the new team could have types that resist these or complement them.

Alternatively, adding a Dragon for its versatility in coverage.

Looking at the remaining indices, perhaps picking 30 (Fire/Ground), 48 (Dragon/Rock), and 49 (Flying).

Wait, let me think about their types:

- 30: FIRE/GROUND
- 48: DRAGON/ROCK
- 49: FLYING

FIRE can be strong against Grass and Water. GROUND covers both Ground and Rock. Dragon adds a versatile type that can cover Dragon, which is not directly countered by any of the previous team's types.

Alternatively, maybe picking 30 (Fire/Ground), 48 (Dragon/Rock), and 32 (Bug/Dragon). But Bug might not be as strong against the previous team.

Wait, perhaps it's better to have a mix of types that can counter each other or cover multiple weaknesses.

Another approach: look for Pokémon with high Max_PP moves, which can be used multiple times in a single turn. For example, index 3 has ELECTRIC moves with high PP.

But I'm not sure if that's the main factor here. The user hasn't specified any changes in move sets beyond what's provided.

Alternatively, perhaps selecting Pokémon with strong offensive moves or wide coverage.

Wait, but since it's a simplified version of Pokémon, maybe the key is to have types that can cover each other's weaknesses.

But without more info on the specifics of how battles work (e.g., type effectiveness), it's hard to know which team would be better. However, based on the previous result and the fact that they won, perhaps keeping similar strong types makes sense while adding a new one for diversity or increased power.

Alternatively, maybe selecting the highest Max_HP Pokémon in each type to maximize survivability.

Looking at Max_HP:

- 13:160
- 14:147
- 4:137
- 0:145
- 9:138

So 13 is the highest. But it's a Ghost, which was already used (index13). So maybe 0:145, which is Psychic/Ghost.

But considering that the previous team had Ghost, adding another might not be optimal unless for coverage.

Alternatively, picking 30:77 HP but strong moves. Maybe it's better to prioritize Max_HP.

Wait, perhaps the user wants a balance between high HP and strong move sets.

Looking at index 30: FIRE/GROUND with decent HP (77) but has access to Steel and Fire moves which can be powerful against many types.

Index 32: BUG/DRAGON, which is a mix of Bug and Dragon. BUG can be good against Grass and Ground, and Dragon adds more versatility.

But without knowing the exact effectiveness in battle, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps picking indices with strong single-type teams that haven't been used much before.

Wait, looking at previous winning teams: [4,13,14]. So 4 is Electric/Rock, 13 is Ghost, and 14 is Ice.

Maybe to avoid duplication, pick types not covered yet or underused.

Looking through the Roster:

Types present in the team: Electric (3), Rock (1), Ghost (9,11,13), Ice (5,7,14). So remaining types include Dragon, Steel, Faerie, Dark, etc.

Perhaps picking 30 (Fire/Ground) which is a mix of Fire and Ground. Ground covers against many physical attacks and is strong against Water and Grass.

Then 48: Dragon/Rock which adds Dragon coverage and Rock, which complements the previous team's Rock.

And 49: Flying, which can be strong against Electric and Ground, but might not add much if the team already has Electric and Rock. Alternatively, perhaps pick another type like Steel or Faerie.

Alternatively, maybe picking 30 (Fire/Ground), 48 (Dragon/Rock), and 45 (Steel). But I need to check their indices.

Wait, 45 is Steel/Fight with Max_HP=160. It might be a good addition for both Steel and Fighting types, which can cover many defensive and offensive needs.

But considering that the previous team had Electric, Rock, Ghost, adding Steel could provide additional coverage against Electric and other types.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to have a mix of strong single-type teams.

Another approach: since the last result was a win, perhaps keeping similar strong types while rotating one for diversity.

So perhaps replacing index14 (Ice) with 30 (Fire/Ground), index4 (Electric/Rock) with 48 (Dragon/ROCK), and keep 13 (Ghost). But wait, we can only choose three indices, not four.

Alternatively, the user's instruction is to pick any three from the roster, regardless of previous usage.

But since it's a simplified version, maybe the optimal team includes types that counter each other or provide coverage against common weaknesses.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to select the highest Max_HP Pokémon with strong move sets that can complement each other.

Looking through the list:

- 13:160 (Ghost)
- 14:147 (Ice)
- 4:137 (Electric/Rock)

But these are already used. So looking for others:

- 0:145 (Psychic/Ghost) – high Max_HP, but Ghost is already covered.
- 6:69 (Steel) – lower HP, but Steel can be useful against Electric and Rock.
- 9:138 (Ghost again)
- 15:120 (Flying/NORMAL) – Normal/Flying
- 16:138 (Dark/Grass)
- 17:98 (Bug/Dragon)
- 18:160 (Psychic/Fire)
- 19:118 (Poison/Fire)
- 20:143 (Dragon/Poison)
- 21:134 (Normal/Flying)
- 22:109 (Rock)
- 23:129 (Fire)
- 24:91 (Psychic/Ghost)
- 25:41 (Normal)
- 26:124 (Faerie)
- 27:119 (Steel)
- 28:148 (Grass)
- 29:95 (Psychic)
- 30:77 (Fire/Ground)
- 31:98 (Rock/Normal)
- 32:90 (Bug/Dragon)
- 33:129 (Flying/Water)
- 34:135 (Poison/Water)
- 35:114 (Fight)
- 36:136 (Dark)
- 37:50 (Grass)
- 38:95 (Water/Ghost)
- 39:106 (Dragon/Ground)
- 40:128 (Grass/Fire)
- 41:160 (Rock)
- 42:98 (Faerie/Ghost)
- 43:119 (Steel/Fight)
- 44:112 (Faerie)
- 45:160 (Steel)
- 46:160 (Rock/Steel)
- 47:98 (Grass/Dragon)
- 48:126 (Dragon/Rock)
- 49:121 (Flying)

Looking for the top Max_HP:

- 18, 20, 41, 43, 45, 46 have Max_HP=160.

So perhaps picking from these would be ideal. Let's check their types and move sets.

- 18: Psychic/Fire – strong Fire moves, but Fire can be weak to Water and Ground.
- 20: Dragon/Poison – Dragon is versatile, Poison is good against Grass and Fairy.
- 41: Rock – solid type with access to Rock moves, which are useful for defense and offense.
- 43: Steel/Fight – Steel is strong against Electric, Rock, Ice; Fight covers physical attacks.
- 45: Steel – same as above, but only Steel.
- 46: Rock/Steel – combination of both.

Since the previous team had Electric/Rock (4), Ghost (13), and Ice (14), adding another Electric or Fire might be useful. But without knowing the exact battle mechanics, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since the last result was a win, maybe continuing with strong types that complement each other.

Looking at 30:77 HP, but strong moves against various types. Maybe it's better to include a mix of high HP and strong move sets.

But without more info, perhaps the best is to select the highest Max_HP not used before. The previous team had 4 (Electric/Rock),13 (Ghost),14 (Ice). So remaining high HP:

- 18:160 (Psychic/Fire)
- 20:143 (Dragon/Poison)
- 41:160 (Rock)
- 43:119 (Steel/Fight)
- 45:160 (Steel)
- 46:160 (Rock/Steel)

Maybe selecting 18, 20, and 41.

But considering that the user's last result was a win with certain types, perhaps it's better to have a team that can counter the previous opponents' strengths.

Alternatively, since the user's instruction is to maximize chances based only on the given info (Roster, previous indices, last result), perhaps the best approach is to pick the three highest Max_HP Pokémon with strong move sets.

The highest are 18,20,41,43,45,46. So perhaps selecting 18,20,41.

But I'm not sure if this is the optimal strategy or if there's a better way.

Alternatively, considering that in the previous battle, the team was [4,13,14], which were Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Ice. The new team should probably have types that counter what they might face next.

Looking at the Roster:

- 18: Psychic/Fire – Fire is common, but maybe not as strong against certain types.
- 20: Dragon/Poison – Dragon is versatile, Poison can be good against Grass and Fairy.
- 41: Rock – solid choice for defense and offense.

Alternatively, selecting 30 (Fire/Ground), which could provide Ground immunity and Fire attacks.

But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated.

Maybe a better approach is to look for Pokémon with strong moves that can support each other or cover multiple types. For example:

- Electric-type moves can deal damage but might be weak against Water and Ground.
- Rock-type moves are good for defense and offense.
- Ghost-type moves can handle Poison and Dark types.
- Fire-type has a wide range of moves.

But without knowing the specific enemies, it's hard to strategize. However, the last result was a win with Elo increased, so perhaps sticking with similar strong types would be beneficial.

Looking at 30: Fire/Ground – Fire is good but Ground can handle Earth types and has access to moves like Sand or Earth-based attacks.

Alternatively, selecting 48 (Dragon/Rock) could provide both Dragon's versatility and Rock for defense.

But I'm not sure. This is a tough decision.

In the end, since I don't have more info, perhaps the best is to choose the highest Max_HP with strong move sets that can cover multiple types.

Okay, so I need to come up with a new Pokémon team after my last team lost. My previous team used indices 30, 48, and 49. Now, I have to choose three new Pokémon from the roster to maximize my chances in the next battle.

First, I should look at what types were used before. Let me check the templates for those indices. Index 30 is FIRE/GROUND, 48 is DRAGON/ROCK, and 49 is FLYING. So my last team had Fire, Ground, Dragon, and Flying types. Since this is a simplified Pokémon version, maybe the effectiveness of moves depends on these types.

I remember that in Pokémon battles, certain types are strong against others. For example, Fire is strong against Grass and Water, but weak to Ice and Rock. Ground is usually strong against Fire, Water, and Grass, but not effective against Flying or Ice. Dragon is a bit neutral but can have some resistances. Flying is strong against Ground and normal moves, but weak to Electric and Rock.

Given that my last team lost, I might need to adjust the types to better counter the previous ones. Alternatively, maybe I should pick Pokémon that are strong against the opponent's types or have good moves that can deal a lot of damage.

Looking at the roster again, I see a lot of options. Let me go through some of them:

- Index 0: Psychic/Ghost. Ghost resists Fighting and Normal, which might be helpful.
- Index 2: Fire/Dragon. Fire could be useful against Grass or Water, but I already had Fire in my last team. Dragon is neutral but can resist certain moves.
- Index 4: Electric/Rock. Rock is strong against Fire and Ice. Electric is good against Flying and Ground, which might help since my previous team used Ground.
- Index 7: Ice. Ice is strong against Fire and Water. That could be good if the opponent has Water or Fire types.
- Index 13: Ghost. Another Ghost type, which can be useful for resistances.
- Index 14: Ice. Similar to index 7, another Ice type for coverage.
- Index 27: Steel. Steel resists Rock and Ice, which could help against those types.
- Index 29: Psychic. Psychic is good against Fighting and Normal, but not sure about others.

I also need to consider the moves each Pokémon has. High attack moves or strong special attacks can be beneficial. For example, Electric moves are strong against Ground and Water, so index 4 could have some powerful moves.

Looking at my previous team's types: Fire/Ground/Dragon/Flying. So if I pick a Ghost type (index 0), it could help against Fighting and Normal, which might not have been covered before. Also, Electric/Rock (index 4) can provide Rock coverage for Ground and Fire, and Electric to take out Flying or Ground.

Another thought: since my last team lost, maybe the opponent had strong attackers. So I should pick Pokémon that can survive longer or have strong defenses. For example, index 0's Max HP is 145, which is quite high. Index 4 has Max HP of 137, also decent.

I also need to look at their move sets for effectiveness. Electric moves in index 4 could be powerful against Ground and Water, which were used by my previous team. So that might help in taking out their Pokémon effectively.

Let me try to put together a team:

- Index 0: Psychic/Ghost. Provides strong defense against Fighting and Normal.
- Index 4: Electric/Rock. Covers Rock (good against Fire and Ice) and Electric (good against Ground and Flying).
- Index 13: Ghost. Another Ghost type for more resistances.

Alternatively, maybe using two Ghosts could be redundant, but it's good for coverage. Or perhaps adding a Steel type (index 27) which resists Rock and Ice, providing more versatility.

Wait, if I choose index 4, that gives me Electric and Rock. Then, maybe index 13 as Ghost, and another type like Ice or Steel. Let's see:

- Index 4: Electric/Rock
- Index 13: Ghost
- Index 27: Steel

Steel can resist Rock and Ice, which might help against the opponent's possible types. Also, Steel has good moves that can be effective.

Another consideration is their move accuracy and power. For example, index 0 has a lot of special moves with decent accuracy, which could be useful for supporting or finishing off opponents.

I think I'll go with indices 4, 13, and 27. Electric/Rock provides good defensive and offensive coverage, Ghost adds more resistances, and Steel covers Rock and Ice resistance while also having strong physical attacks.

Okay, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, the previous battle resulted in a loss, and the Elo has dropped to 1186.40. The last winning team used indices [4, 13, 14]. Now, I need to select a new team from the roster that can maximize their chances of winning the next battle.

Looking at the Roster, each Pokémon has specific types, Max_HP, and moves. My goal is to pick three Pokémon that can cover multiple types effectively and have strong moves to counter the opposing team's types.

The previous successful team used indices 4, 13, 14. Let me check those:

- Index 4: Type Electric/Rock with high HP (137) and useful moves like Steel, which is good against Rock.
- Index 13: Ghost type with strong Dragon and Fairy moves, which can be versatile.
- Index 14: Ice type with Normal and Ice moves, providing coverage for multiple types.

Since they lost last time, maybe the opposing team had strong counters. To improve, I should consider Pokémon that can cover common weaknesses or have strong offensive moves.

Looking through the Roster again:

- Pkm 27 is Flying/Normal with high HP (120) and a variety of moves including Dragon, which might be good.
- Pkm 30 is Fire/Ground, which could pair well with Ghost for coverage against Ground and provide fire resistance.
- Pkm 49 is Flying with Ice moves, which can help control the battlefield.

Alternatively, maybe choosing Electric/Rock again would be strong since it's a solid type combo. Let me see:

- Index 4 (Electric/Rock) has Steel, which is strong against Rock.
- Maybe another Ghost or Dark for coverage against certain types.
- Perhaps Pkm 13 (Ghost) and Pkm 14 (Ice) as before.

Wait, the user mentioned that their last team lost. So maybe the opposing team had specific counters. To prevent that, I should look for Pokémon with type coverage that's hard to counter.

Electric/Rock (4) is solid, but maybe adding a Ghost or Dark would help against common types like Water, Ground, etc.

Looking at other options:

- Pkm 27: Flying/Normal could be good for covering Bird moves and providing Normal resistance.
- Pkm 30: Fire/Ground can cover Fire and Ground, which are strong types.
- Pkm 49: Ice/Flying can control the battlefield with Ice moves and provide Flying coverage.

Alternatively, if I want to stick with Electric/Rock but add another strong type:

- Maybe include a Dragon or Dark Pokémon for additional flexibility.

Wait, Pkm 4 is Electric/Rock, which is good against Electric and Rock. But maybe adding a Ghost would allow them to resist Ghost moves and also provide their own offensive moves.

So, perhaps the new team could be 4 (Electric/Rock), 13 (Ghost), and another strong support like 14 (Ice) or 27 (Flying/Normal).

Alternatively, if I think about type coverage:

- Electric for support
- Rock for physical attacks
- Ghost for resistance and offensive moves

So, maybe indices 4, 13, and 14 again. But since the last team lost, perhaps adding different types would help.

Another approach: look for Pokémon with high Max_HP to survive longer battles.

Pkm 4 has Max_HP 137, which is quite high. Pkm 13 has 160 HP, even higher. So maybe using those two plus another strong one like 14 (147 HP) could be a good balance.

Alternatively, consider the effectiveness of their moves. For example, having multiple types that can hit through each other's weaknesses.

I think the best approach is to select Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Ice as they cover multiple type weaknesses and have strong offensive moves.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to choose the next Pokémon team based on the given information. The user's last team won with indices [4, 13, 14], and their Elo is now 1200.23. So, they probably want a new team that's strong but also considers their previous successful lineup.

First, I'll look at the Roster provided. Each Pokémon has Type, Max_HP, and Moves. The goal is to select three Pokémon that can complement each other and have moves that are effective against common types in the previous team or against each other.

The previous team used indices 4, 13, 14. Let me check those:

- Index 4: Electric/Rock
- Index 13: Ghost
- Index 14: Ice

So their types were Electric/Rock (index 4), Ghost (13), and Ice (14). Now, the new team should ideally counter or complement these types.

Looking for a strong Electric Pokémon again could be good because it's already part of the roster. Maybe index 30 is Electric/Ground. It has moves like Steel and Ground, which can cover multiple types.

Index 13 is Ghost, so maybe adding another Ghost would help with type coverage. Index 49 is FLYING, but let me check—index 14 is Ice, so having a Ghost alongside Ice might provide good coverage against certain types.

Wait, index 4 (Electric/Rock) could be paired with index 30 (Electric/Ground). Both are Electric, which can help in battles by covering multiple type weaknesses. Plus, Ground can counter Grass and Rock, which were part of the previous team's types.

Then, adding a Ghost or Ice Pokémon would be beneficial. Index 13 is Ghost, but maybe another Ghost like index 9 (Ghost) could provide more support. Or perhaps index 49 is FLYING, which might not directly counter but can have some utility moves.

Wait, let me think again. The previous team had Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Ice. So their types were covering Electric, Rock, Ghost, and Ice. For the next team, maybe focusing on types that are strong against these or have good coverage.

Electric is strong against Water and Ground. Rock is strong against Flying, Ice, Fire, etc. Ghost is strong against Dark and Poison. Ice is strong against Grass and Fire.

So, a new team could include Electric (index 30) to cover Water and Ground, maybe another type that's strong against Electric, like Water or Ground. But since the previous team had Electric/Rock, adding another Ground type would be good for coverage. So index 30 is Electric/Ground, which covers both.

Then, perhaps a Ghost for dark resistances, but index 13 is already used. Maybe index 49, which is FLYING. Flying can cover Electric and has access to Dragon moves, which are strong against Ice. Wait, but the previous team had Ice at index 14. So having a Flyer could help with that.

Alternatively, maybe index 9: Ghost. It would add another Ghost, which is good for countering Dark and Poison. But I'm not sure if it's better than index 13 or index 49.

Wait, the previous team used 4 (Electric/Rock), 13 (Ghost), 14 (Ice). So maybe the new team should include types that can cover what was previously weak or add new strengths.

Electric is strong against Water and Ground. Rock is strong against Fire and Ice. Ghost is strong against Dark and Poison. Ice is strong against Grass and Fire.

So, for the new team, perhaps including:

- Electric/Ground (index 30) to cover Water and Ground, which are weak against Electric.
- FLYING (index 49) because it can help with Electric and also has access to Dragon moves that counter Ice.
- Another type that covers something else. Maybe Ghost or Dark.

Wait, but the user's last team had three types: Electric/Rock, Ghost, Ice. So their types were covering a lot of ground. The new team should perhaps include strong attackers against those types.

Alternatively, maybe index 30 (Electric/Ground) is good because Ground can counter Grass and Rock. Then, adding another type that's strong against Electric or Rock. Maybe a Water type for Electric's weakness. But I don't see a strong Water besides index 14 which was already used.

Wait, the previous team had index 4: Electric/Rock, so their types were Electric and Rock. So perhaps including a Ground Pokémon to counter Grass and Rock would be beneficial, as well as another type that covers either Ghost or Ice.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the indices again:

The user's last team won with 4,13,14: Electric/Rock, Ghost, Ice.

So their types were:

- Electric (4): can be countered by Ground and Water.
- Rock (4): countered by Flying, Ice, Fire.
- Ghost (13): countered by Dark, Poison.
- Ice (14): countered by Grass, Fire.

To counter this team, the opponent might use:

- Ground to counter Electric and Rock.
- Dark/Shadow to counter Ghost.
- Grass/Fire to counter Ice.

So, for the new team, including Ground would be good. Index 30 is Electric/Ground, which can handle both Electric and Rock. Then, maybe a Dark type like index 8 (Dark) or index 9 (Ghost). Or perhaps another Ice type but since 14 was used, maybe a Ghost instead.

Alternatively, including a Fire type to counter Ice.

Wait, the user's last team had Ice, so adding a Fire type would be good. But looking at the Roster, there are several Fire types like index 1,2,3, etc. Maybe include a Fire/DRAGON (index 2) which is strong against Electric and has Dragon moves that counter Ice.

So perhaps:

- Index 30: Electric/Ground
- Index 2: Fire/Dragon
- Index 49: FLYING

FLYING can cover Electric and has Dragon moves to counter Ice. Fire/DRAGON would handle both Fire and Electric, and also counter Ice with Dragon moves. Electric/Ground handles Ground and counters Electric and Rock.

This combination seems strong because:

- Electric/Ground covers Electric and Rock.
- Fire/Dragon covers Fire and counters Electric and Ice.
- FLYING covers Electric and has Dragon moves to counter Ice.

Alternatively, maybe index 30 (Electric/Ground), index 49 (FLYING), and index 14 (Ice). But 14 was used before. Or perhaps index 13 is Ghost again, but it's already in the previous team.

Wait, no, the user's last team had indices [4,13,14]. So they can reuse types as long as the indices are different.

So, maybe:

- Index 30: Electric/Ground
- Index 2: Fire/DRAGON
- Index 49: FLYING

This would give a well-rounded team with coverage against various types and strong moves.

Okay, so I need to help choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The user has provided a list of 50 Pokémon templates with their types, Max_HP, and moves. The previous team used indices [30, 2, 49], which correspond to the following Pokémon:

- Index 30: Type FIRE/GROUND
- Index 2: Type FIRE/DRAGON
- Index 49: Type FLYING

The last battle was won with an Elo of 1215.25. So I'm assuming the previous team did well, but I need to figure out what makes a good new team.

First, let's look at the types of the previous Pokémon. They are FIRE, FIRE/DRAGON, and FLYING. It might be beneficial to stick with similar types or complementary ones for synergy.

Next, each Pokémon has specific moves that could be effective in battles. I should consider the effectiveness of their moves against certain types. For example, if a Pokémon has strong Electric moves, it's good against Ground types.

Now, considering the previous success, maybe continuing with types that were effective before would be wise. However, since the user wants to maximize chances, perhaps introducing new types could provide more flexibility or stronger moves.

Looking at the Roster, I should evaluate each Pokémon based on their type coverage and move sets. For example, Electric-type Pokémon are strong against Ground, which was used in index 30. Fire is good against Ground as well, so that might be useful. Flying can cover skies but maybe doesn't offer much else.

I notice some interesting Pokémon not in the previous team:

- Index 4: ELECTRIC/ROCK with high Max_HP.
- Index 13: GHOST with strong moves including Dragon and Fairy.
- Index 14: ICE with Normal and Fire moves, which could be useful against certain types.
- Index 7: ICE with FLYING, which might complement Flying.
- Index 8: DARK with Ground moves, which could work well with Ground resistance.

I should check if these Pokémon have strong moves that can help in battle. For instance, Electric/ Rock (4) has Steel and other strong moves. Ghost (13) can be good against Dark and Grass, which might help if the opponent has those types.

Since the previous team was FIRE/GROUND/FIRE/DRAGON/FLYING, maybe adding a Ghost or Dark type would provide coverage against certain typings that Fire might not cover as well. Also, Electric could add more offensive power.

I also need to consider Max_HP and accuracy of the moves. Higher HP is better for survivability, and accurate moves are more reliable in combat.

Looking at index 4: Type ELECTRIC/ROCK with Max_HP 137. It has Steel move which can be effective against Rock and Ice types. Also, it has Electric which is good against Ground and Water. That seems versatile.

Index 13: GHOST has Dragon and Fairy moves. Dragon is strong against Dark and Ghost, which could help in dealing with certain opponents.

Index 14: ICE has Normal and Fire moves. Normal can be used on Rock types, and Fire can be used on Grass and Water.

Indices 7 and 8 also look good, but maybe including one Electric type for the Ground resistance would be beneficial since the previous team had Ground already.

I should also check if there are any overlaps in types that might not be beneficial. For example, having too many Fire types could limit the effectiveness against certain typings.

So, I think a combination of Electric/Rock (4), Ghost (13), and Ice (14) would provide good coverage. Electric for Ground resistance, Ghost for various resistances, and Ice for Normal and Fire moves.

Alternatively, maybe including a Dragon type like index 2 could be beneficial since it's already used before but might still be effective.

Wait, the user wants to avoid using the same indices as the previous team unless necessary. The previous team had [30, 2, 49], so I should not include those again if possible.

So, new indices would need to be different from these. Let me check:

- 4: Not used before
- 13: Not used
- 14: Not used

That's a good mix. Alternatively, maybe including index 7 (ICE) and another type could work too, but I think the combination of Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Ice provides solid coverage.

So, I'll go with indices 4, 13, and 14.

Okay, so I need to help create a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The user provided the Roster, previous team indices [4, 13, 14], and the last result that their team lost with an Elo of approximately 1201.57.

First, I should look at what the previous team was. Indices 4, 13, and 14 correspond to certain Pokémon templates. Let me check those:

- Index 4: Type is ELECTRIC/ROCK, Max_HP=137, Moves include STEEL, Power 102, Accuracy 0.81, etc.
- Index 13: Type GHOST, Max_HP=160, with moves like DRAGON, FAIRY, NORMAL, and DARK.
- Index 14: Type ICE, Max_HP=147, with moves like NORMAL, FIRE, and ELECTRIC.

Since the last team lost, I need to find a better combination. The goal is to maximize chances in the next battle, so I should consider the strengths and weaknesses of each Pokémon.

Looking at the types:

- Type GHOST: Good against GHOST, PSYCHIC, and Dark/Normal types; weak against BATTY (not sure if that's relevant here) and maybe others.
- Type ICE: Can be strong in cold areas but might have specific weaknesses.
- Type ELECTRIC/ROCK: Rock is solid, Electric can vary.

I should check if the previous team had any type coverage or if there are types that could better counter the opposing team. Also, considering Max_HP and moves' effectiveness, I want to pick Pokémon that can perform well in battles, maybe with high accuracy or powerful moves.

Looking through the Roster again, I need to find three Pokémon that might complement each other's types. Maybe adding a type that is strong against what the previous team was weak against.

Also, considering the Elo drop, perhaps the last team had some weaknesses that led to the loss, so avoiding those same types or using stronger ones could help.

I should look for Pokémon with good stats and moves that can support each other in battle. Maybe a mix of offense and defense, but since it's only three, maybe focus on high damage or key typings.

Let me go through some indices:

- Index 7: Type ICE, Max_HP=105. Moves include FLYING, TOXIC_SPIKES, RAIN. That could add a strong type with useful moves.
- Index 17: Type BUG/DRAGON, Max_HP=98. Could provide dragon type which is strong against ICE, which was in the previous team? Wait, no, dragon is weak to ice? Or wait, Dragon's effectiveness depends on the move's type. But in this case, the move types might be important.

Alternatively, looking for Pokémon with types that can cover each other's weaknesses.

Wait, perhaps it's better to pick types that are strong against others. For example, GHOST is strong against BATTY (though I don't see BATTY here), and ICE is good against WATER and GRASS.

Looking at the previous team: 4 (ELECTRIC/ROCK), 13 (GHOST), 14 (ICE). So they have Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Ice. Maybe the opponent last time had types that countered this setup.

To improve, maybe add a type that's strong against Electric or Rock, like Ground or Water. Alternatively, adding another Ghost for better coverage.

Wait, index 9 is GHOST with Max_HP=138. It could provide another Ghost type, which might be good if the last team lost due to not enough Ghost resistance.

Alternatively, index 8: Type DARK, which can resist GHOST and has some powerful moves. Or index 12: Water, which can counter Electric perhaps.

Wait, the user's last result was a loss with Elo around 1201.57. So maybe the previous team wasn't strong enough against certain types. Maybe adding a more powerful type would help.

Looking at index 4 again: ELECTRIC/ROCK. That could be good for dealing with Water or Grass types, and Rock is solid against many.

Index 13: GHOST can handle Psychic and Batty (if applicable). But maybe the opponent had a Dark type that was strong, so adding something like Dark or Ghost again might help.

Alternatively, index 30: Type FIRE/GROUND. Ground is good against Electric, Water, and Ice. So if the previous team had Electric/Rock, Ground could counter that. Also, Fire can be strong against Grass and Water.

So maybe combining a GHOST, an ICE, and a FIRE/GROUND would provide good type coverage.

Wait, but the previous team already had ICE (index 14) and GHOST (13). So adding another type like FIRE/GROUND (30) could balance it. Also, index 30's moves include Ground, which is strong against Electric/ROCK's weak points.

Alternatively, perhaps replacing one of the existing indices with a stronger one.

Looking at index 7: ICE. It has moves that can handle FLYING and TOXIC_SPIKES, but maybe another type would be better.

Wait, let me think about the types:

- Ghost: Good vs Psychic, Batty, Dark.
- Electric/Rock: Strong against Water, Ground, Ice (due to Rock) and Electric is strong against Flying, etc.
- Ice: Weak to Fire, but strong against Water and Grass.

So if the opponent had a team with Fire, that could have beaten Ice. So maybe adding a type that's strong against Fire would help, like Water or Rock.

Alternatively, perhaps index 30 (FIRE/GROUND) can provide both Ground (good against Electric/ROCK) and Fire (to counter Ice's weakness). So replacing one of the previous indices with 30 might be beneficial.

But the previous team had Electric/ROCK, Ghost, and Ice. If I replace, say, Ghost with FIRE/GROUND (30), then the team would have Electric/Rock, FIRE/GROUND, and Ice.

Wait, but the user's last loss was against a team that perhaps used Fire types effectively. So adding a Ground type could help counter both Electric and Fire.

Alternatively, maybe index 17: BUG/DRAGON. Dragon is strong against Ice, which could be good if the previous Ice wasn't performing well.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to look for Pokémon with high Max_HP or strong moves that can deal consistent damage.

Another approach is to check which Pokémon have high accuracy and powerful moves, as that can make a big difference in battles.

Looking at index 4: ELECTRIC/ROCK. Moves include STEEL, Power 102, etc. That's quite strong.

Index 13: GHOST has DRAGON with Power 140, which is very high.

Index 14: ICE has NORMAL and FIRE moves, but Normal might not be the strongest unless it's against Grass or Water.

So perhaps keeping these three but looking for a fourth? No, only choose three. So maybe replacing one with another strong type.

Alternatively, considering the previous team had Electric/ROCK (4), Ghost (13), Ice (14). If I replace, say, 14 (Ice) with 30 (FIRE/GROUND), then the team would have Electric/ROCK, Ghost, FIRE/GROUND.

This way, Ground can counter Electric and Fire, and Ghost can handle Psychic and Batty. Electric/Rock covers Water and Grass, and Fire covers Ice's weakness.

Alternatively, maybe index 8: Type DARK. Dark resists Ghost, which could be useful if the opponent had Ghosts.

But I'm not sure about the previous battle's specifics beyond the result.

Another angle is that in the previous battle, the team lost. So perhaps the composition was not strong enough. Maybe adding a Pokémon with higher Max_HP or better moves would help.

Looking at index 4: Max_HP=137; 13:160; 14:147. So 13 has the highest HP. Maybe keeping that is good.

Alternatively, maybe replacing Electric/ROCK (index4) with a stronger type, like Dark or Dragon.

Wait, let's look at other types:

- Type Dark can be strong against Ghost and Batty, which might have been problematic if opponent had those.
- Type Steel is also strong against Rock, but the current team has Rock in index1? No, index4 is Electric/ROCK. So Steel could counter that.

But I don't see a Steel type in the roster anymore. Wait, let me check:

Looking at the Roster provided, there's index 41: ROCK, which is pure Rock. Other types like Steel are present as well, such as index43: STEEL/FIGHT.

So maybe replacing Electric/ROCK with Steel could help. But I don't have a Steel type in my previous team; index4 is Electric/ROCK.

Wait, if I replace 4 (Electric/ROCK) with 43 (STEEL/FIGHT), then the team would have Steel, Ghost, Ice.

Steel can handle Rock and Ground, which could be good. But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps keeping the same types but optimizing for higher Power or better accuracy.

Another consideration is that in the previous battle, the team lost, so maybe the moves used weren't effective. Perhaps choosing Pokémon with stronger moves against common opponents would help.

Looking at index4: ELECTRIC/ROCK has moves like Steel (Power 102) which is strong. Ghost has Dragon (140 Power). Ice has Normal and Fire, which can be good against Water and Grass.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Pokémon that's strong against both Electric and Ice, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps index7: ICE. It has FLYING with high power 140. Maybe including it could help in future battles where Flying types are common.

But without knowing the opponent's team, it's difficult.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon that have high Max PP or accuracy, as that can make moves more reliable.

Index4: ELECTRIC/ROCK has several moves with high PP and accuracy. Similarly, Ghost (13) has Dragon with 140 Power and high PP.

Alternatively, maybe index30: FIRE/GROUND has Ground, which is strong against Electric, so that could be useful if the opponent uses Electric types.

So perhaps the new team would be [4,13,30].

Wait, but let me check their moves:

- 4: Type Electric/Rock. Moves include Steel (Power 102), which can take down Rock types. Also has other strong moves.
- 13: Ghost. Strong against Psychic and Batty. Has Dragon with high Power.
- 30: Fire/Ground. Ground is good against Electric and Water. Fire is good against Ice, which could counter the previous Ice's weakness.

Alternatively, maybe replacing index14 (Ice) with 30 would make the team more versatile.

So the new team could be [4,13,30].

But I'm not entirely sure if that's the best combination.

Wait, another thought: the user lost the last battle. So perhaps their previous team composition was not optimal. Maybe they need to switch out a weaker Pokémon for a stronger one.

Looking at index14: ICE has Normal with Power 51 and accuracy 0.91. That's decent but not the highest.

Alternatively, maybe index7: ICE has FLYING with high power. Including it might help in future battles where Flying is used.

But without more info, it's hard to say.

I think the best approach is to try to include strong all-rounders that can cover multiple types and have high Power moves.

So perhaps 4 (Electric/Rock), 13 (Ghost), and 30 (Fire/Ground) would be a good mix. Electric covers Rock and Ground, Ghost covers Psychic and Batty, Fire/Ground covers Electric and Water.

Alternatively, maybe including a Steel type for better coverage against Rock and Ground.

But in the given Roster, the available indices are [4,13,14], which were the previous team's indices. So I can't include others unless I think they're better.

Wait, no: the user is building a new team from all 49 templates. The previous team was [4,13,14]. Now, they need to choose a new team of three from the entire Roster.

So perhaps it's better to pick Pokémon that are strong against common opponents or have wide-range moves.

Another thing to consider: in the previous battle, the team lost, so maybe their moves didn't work well. Perhaps selecting Pokémon with more versatile move types would help.

Looking at index4: Electric/Rock has a variety of moves including Steel, which is good against Rock, and Electric, which can deal with Water and Ground.

Index13: Ghost has Dragon and Fairy moves, which are versatile.

Index30: Fire/Ground has both Fire and Ground moves. Ground is good against Electric and Water.

So combining these types might provide coverage against many possibilities.

Alternatively, maybe including a Dark type for resistances against Ghosts and Batty.

But since the user lost last time, perhaps their team composition wasn't optimized.

In conclusion, I think choosing [4,13,30] would be a good new team. It includes Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Fire/Ground, which covers multiple types and has strong moves.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what Pokémon team to choose next based on the information given. My last team won, and my Elo is now 1216.70. The previous team that won had the indices [4, 13, 30]. Now, I need to select a new set of three Pokémon from the provided roster.

First, I should look at what each of these indices represents. Each index corresponds to a Pokémon template with specific stats and moves. My goal is to pick a team that's strong for the next battle. Since my last team won, maybe there are some patterns or strengths in those Pokémon that I can build upon.

Looking at the previous winning team: indices 4, 13, and 30. Let me check what each of these Pokémon are like.

- Index 4 is Type Electric/Rock with Max HP 137 and a variety of moves, including Steel, Power 102, Accuracy 0.81, etc.
- Index 13 is Ghost with Max HP 160 and strong moves like Dragon, Power 140, etc.
- Index 30 is Fire/Ground with Max HP 77 and moves like Steel, Power 108, etc.

So, my previous team had a mix of Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Fire/Ground types. These seem to cover a range of types that are effective against each other, possibly leading to type advantages in battles.

Now, for the new team, I should consider similar strengths or complementary types. Maybe focusing on types that were underrepresented before or have strong moves that can synergize well.

Looking at the roster again, I need to find three Pokémon that together would be strong. Let's see what other indices might complement my previous choices.

I should also think about the effectiveness of their moves and how they can counter each other's weaknesses. For example, having a Ghost type can deal with certain types effectively, while Electric can cover multiple types like Water and Ground.

Also, considering Max HP is important because higher HP means more survivability, which can be crucial in battles, especially if the opponent has strong moves.

Another factor is the accuracy of their moves. High accuracy can help in ensuring that moves land, while low accuracy might require more precise play to avoid missing.

I should also look for Pokémon that have moves that can chip away at the opponent's team, like multi-type attackers or those with status moves or boosts.

Let me go through the available indices and see which ones could fit well. Maybe looking for a mix of types that are strong against each other. For example, Electric, Rock, and Ghost might be a good combination as they can cover each other's weaknesses.

Looking at index 4 again (Electric/Rock), it has both Electric and Rock moves, making it versatile. Index 13 (Ghost) is great for dealing with things like Dark or Poison types, which might be useful. Index 30 (Fire/Ground) adds Fire and Ground coverage.

Now, are there other indices that could work better? Let's see:

- Index 2: Fire/Dragon. Maybe not the best if I already have a Fire type.
- Index 3: Electric/Bug. Bug can be good against Grass and Psychic, but maybe not as strong as having Rock for Ground.
- Index 7: Ice. Maybe useful if there are Water or Grass opponents, but I don't know the opponent yet.
- Index 14: Ice. Similar to 7.
- Index 20: Dragon/ Poison. Could be good against Steel and Dark types.
- Index 21: Normal/Flying. Flying is good against Ground and Water, but Normal might not offer as much offensive power.
- Index 26: Fairy. Good against Dark, but maybe not as versatile.
- Index 30: Fire/Ground. This seems solid because Ground covers Rock and Earth, and Fire can handle Grass and Water.

Wait, I already have Fire in my previous team with index 30, so adding another Fire type might not be necessary unless it's significantly better. Let me check other types:

- Index 8: Dark. Dark is good against Bulbasaur and Rock, but again, maybe not as strong as having Electric for Water or Ground.

Another thought: maybe I can include a Dragon type because they are multi-effective. Index 2 is Fire/Dragon, which could be useful against Steel and Ice types.

Alternatively, index 17: Bug/Dragon. Dragon could help with multiple types, but Bug might not be the strongest unless there's Grass involved.

I think it's important to have a mix of types that can cover each other. For example, Electric covers Water and Ground, Rock covers Fire and Earth, and Ghost covers Dark and Poison.

Looking back at my previous team, I had Electric/Rock (4), Ghost (13), and Fire/Ground (30). So maybe this time, to vary it up, I could include another Ghost or perhaps a Dragon type for added versatility.

Wait, the user's last result was that their team won, so they might have strategies that worked before. Maybe sticking with similar types would be safe, but also considering new options could help.

Let me see what other strong Pokémon are available:

- Index 13: Ghost is strong because it can handle Dark and Poison types effectively.
- Index 4: Electric/Rock is solid for multiple purposes.
- Index 30: Fire/Ground is good against Water and Grass, but also Ground covers Rock which is useful.

If I choose another Ghost, maybe index 11 or 9, but they might have lower HP. Let's compare:

- Index 11: Ghost with Max HP 125. That's higher than index 13 (160 vs 125). So index 13 is better for survivability.
- Index 9: Ghost with Max HP 138. That's even better.

So maybe including another Ghost would be beneficial, but I don't know if that's necessary because my previous team already had a Ghost.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a Dragon type to have more multi-effective moves.

Looking at index 2: Fire/Dragon, which could help against Steel and Ice.

But I also need three Pokémon. Let me try to pick the best options:

1. Electric/Rock (4) - Provides Electric and Rock coverage.
2. Ghost (13) - Good against Dark and Poison.
3. Dragon/Fire (30) - Fire can cover Grass and Water, and Dragon is good against Steel.

Wait, but index 30 is Fire/Ground, which covers Ground as well. So maybe that's better for handling multiple types.

Alternatively, if I take Dragon, it might help more in certain matchups.

I think the key is to have a balance of types that can cover each other and be effective against common opponents.

Another thought: maybe include a Fairy type because it's strong against Dark and Poison. Index 42 is Fairy/Ghost, which could be useful if there are Dark or Poison types on the opponent's team.

But without knowing the opponent's team, it's hard to say. So perhaps safer to stick with what worked before.

In my previous team, I had Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Fire/Ground. This time, maybe I can replace one of them with another strong Pokémon.

Looking at index 20: Dragon/ Poison. Dragon is good against Steel and Ice, and Poison is effective against Grass and Water. So if the opponent has a lot of Water or Grass, this could be useful.

Alternatively, index 17: Bug/Dragon. Bug can handle Grass and Psychic, while Dragon covers multiple types.

But Bug might not be as strong as Rock for Ground coverage.

Wait, another approach: since my last team won with specific indices, maybe the algorithm should choose based on past success. The previous winning teams are [4,13,14], [2,30,49], [4,13,30].

So looking at these, they all include 4 and 13 often. So perhaps keeping those could be beneficial.

Looking at the Roster:

- Index 4: Electric/Rock
- Index 13: Ghost

These two were part of multiple successful teams.

What about adding another strong Pokémon? Maybe index 49 is FLYING, which can help with Ice and Water types.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe including a Steel type could be useful for coverage against Rock and Ground.

Looking at the available Steel types: index 41 is Rock, but it's pure Rock. Index 43 is Steel/Fight.

So perhaps if I include a Steel type, that might help.

Wait, in my previous team, I had Fire/Ground (30), which can handle Water and Grass, and Electric/Rock (4) covers Water and Ground as well. So maybe adding another Ghost could be redundant.

Alternatively, to have more multi-effective Pokémon, perhaps include a Dragon or Fairy type.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to optimize.

Another angle: check the move sets for each index and see what they can contribute that others don't.

Index 4: Electric/Rock. Moves include Electric which is strong against Water and Ground, and Rock which is good against Fire and Ice.

Index 13: Ghost. Good against Dark and Poison.

Index 30: Fire/Ground. Fire covers Grass and Water, and Ground covers Rock and Earth.

So all three types cover multiple weaknesses.

If I need to choose a new team, perhaps replacing one of them with another strong Pokémon that complements their strengths.

Looking at index 14: Ice. Moves include Normal, which is neutral but can be useful against Psychic and Fighting, and Ice for Grass and Water.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe including a Dark type (index 8) could help with certain opponents.

Wait, another strategy: look at each Pokémon's effectiveness across different types and see which combination covers the most weaknesses.

Electric/Rock covers Electric, Rock. Ghost covers Ghost. Fire/Ground covers Fire, Ground.

So together, they cover Electric, Rock, Fire, Ground, and Ghost.

If I replace one of them with a type that adds more coverage, like Dragon or Steel.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to prioritize.

Alternatively, perhaps focus on high HP and strong moves for better survivability.

Looking at the Roster:

- Index 4: Electric/Rock, Max HP 137
- Index 13: Ghost, Max HP 160 (highest)
- Index 30: Fire/Ground, Max HP 77

So index 13 has the highest HP, which is good for survivability. Index 4 also has decent HP at 137.

If I want a new team, maybe include another strong Pokémon with high HP and complementary types.

Looking at index 12: Water. Max HP 83. Not too bad.

Index 7: Ice, Max HP 105.

Index 9: Ghost, Max HP 138.

Index 13: Ghost, Max HP 160.

So perhaps choosing the highest HP for each type to maximize survivability.

Alternatively, maybe a team with high HP and diverse types would be better.

But I need exactly three indices. So perhaps selecting the best options based on HP and coverage.

Wait, another approach is to look at previous successful teams:

- [4,13,14]: 4(Electric/Rock),13(Ghost),14(Ice)
- [2,30,49]: 2(Fire/Dragon),30(Fire/Ground),49(FLYING)
- [4,13,30]: 4,13,30

So in these teams, they often include 4 and 13. Maybe sticking with those and adding another strong Pokémon.

Looking at the Roster:

After 4,13, maybe add 14 (Ice) or 49 (FLYING). But I'm not sure if that's better than other options.

Alternatively, looking for a Pokémon with both high HP and strong move coverage.

Wait, index 13 is Ghost type with Max HP 160, which is the highest. So including it is probably a good idea for survivability.

Index 4: Electric/Rock, Max HP 137.

So these two are solid choices.

Then, what's the third Pokémon? Maybe another strong type that complements them.

Looking at the types they cover:

- Electric covers Water and Ground.
- Rock covers Fire and Ice.
- Ghost covers Dark and Poison.

So together, they cover a lot of types. But maybe adding a Dragon or Steel could help against specific moves or types.

Wait, in the previous successful team [4,13,30], 30 is Fire/Ground. So Fire complements Rock's weakness to Fire? Wait no, Rock resists Fire. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe including a Grass type would help against Ground and Rock.

Looking at index 28: Grass, Max HP 148.

But I don't know if that's better than other options.

Alternatively, perhaps including a Water type for Electric's effectiveness.

Index 12: Water, Max HP 83.

But again, not sure.

Wait, maybe the best approach is to pick the top three Pokémon based on Max HP and type coverage.

Looking through the Roster:

1. Index 13: Ghost, Max HP 160 (highest)
2. Index 4: Electric/Rock, Max HP 137
3. Index 28: Grass, Max HP 148

So [13,4,28] would be a team with high HP and diverse types.

Alternatively, maybe including index 14 (Ice) for more coverage against Water and Grass.

But I'm not sure. It's a bit of a guessing game without knowing the opponent's types.

Another angle: look at the moves each Pokémon has to see if they can cover each other's weaknesses.

For example:

- Electric/Rock (4): Can handle Water, Ground, Fire, Ice.
- Ghost (13): Handles Dark, Poison.
- Grass (28): Good against Water, Fire, Earth.

But without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to optimize.

Alternatively, perhaps focus on the highest HP and best move sets for each type.

In conclusion, considering past successful teams and high HP, I might choose [4,13,30] again since they worked before. Or maybe include 14 (Ice) as a third member.

Okay, so I need to figure out what's the best Pokémon team to choose next based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what I have.

First, the user provided a list of Pokémon templates, each with their Type, Max_HP, and Moves. Then there are previous teams that were used, which were indices [4, 13, 30]. The last result was a win, so my Elo went up to 1233.14. My goal is to select three Pokémon from the roster that will maximize my chances in the next battle.

I think I should consider what worked well before and what might improve upon it. Let's look at the previous team: indices 4, 13, and 30.

- Index 4: Type ELECTRIC/ROCK. That seems like a good balance of electric attacks and rock moves.
- Index 13: Type GHOST. Ghost types are good for defense and have moves that can be really effective against certain opponents.
- Index 30: Type FIRE/GROUND. Fire is a strong offensive type, and ground covers some resistances.

So the previous team was ELECTRIC/ROCK (4), GHOST (13), and FIRE/GROUND (30). I need to see if these types cover each other well and if adding different ones could be better.

Looking at the new roster, I should check which Pokémon can complement or improve upon the previous team. Maybe adding a dragon type for some coverage, or another electric type for more versatility.

I also need to consider individual strengths of each Pokémon. For example, index 4 (ELECTRIC/ROCK) has moves like Steel and other strong options. Index 13 is Ghost with Dragon and Fairy moves. Index 30 is Fire/Ground with Steel and Normal attacks.

Now, I should see if there are better candidates for each role. Maybe adding a Water type for coverage, or another Electric Pokémon for more powerful moves. Alternatively, perhaps including a Dark type for better defensive options.

I'll list out some strong candidates:

- Index 4: ELECTRIC/ROCK is solid.
- Index 13: GHOST is good for defense and has Dragon moves which are versatile.
- Maybe replacing index 30 with another Fire type that has more powerful moves, like index 18 (Psychic/Fire) or index 19 (Poison/Fire).
- Or perhaps adding a Water type to cover water resistances. Looking at index 12 (Water), it's not in the previous team and could provide good coverage.

I should also check their Max HP and PP to ensure they can survive battles. Higher Max HP is better, as is more PP for moves.

Another consideration is the types' effectiveness against each other. For example, Electric vs Ground is a type advantage, so having both might be beneficial.

Wait, but the previous team already has Electric (4) and Ground (30). So maybe adding another type that complements them without overlapping too much.

I think I should try to find a team where each Pokémon can cover different types or provide strong moves. Let me look at some other indices:

- Index 14: ICE. Could be useful for cold resistance, but not sure if it's better than existing.
- Index 30 is already used; maybe index 18 (Psychic/Fire) as a replacement.
- Alternatively, index 32 (Bug/Dragon) could add dragon type and bug coverage.

But I need three Pokémon. Let me evaluate each possible trio:

Option 1: Keep 4,13,30.

Option 2: Replace 30 with another Fire/Psychic like 18 or 19.

Option 3: Add a Water/Poison (like index 12) and maybe replace one of them.

I also need to consider the last result was a win, so perhaps adding a strong attacker could help in getting more advantages. Alternatively, ensuring defensive coverage is good.

Another approach is to look for Pokémon with high Max HP and strong moves. For example, index 13 has Max HP 160, which is quite high, making it a good defender. Index 4 also has Max HP 137, so they are both solid in terms of health.

Maybe I should include index 18 (Psychic/Fire) to add more Fire attacks and some Psychic moves that might be useful. Also, index 32 (Bug/Dragon) adds Bug and Dragon types which can cover a lot of ground in terms of resistances.

Wait, but the previous team already has Ghost (13), so adding another type like Water could provide good coverage against Water resistances, but I need to ensure they don't overlap too much.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a Dark type for better defensive moves and resistances. Looking at index 8 (Dark) or 9 (Ghost). But Ghost is already in the team.

Maybe it's better to stick with the current team because they've been working well. The previous team won, so maybe adding someone who can help in different areas without breaking the existing structure.

Wait, but the user might be expecting a change-up to exploit new strategies or counter potential weaknesses from last time.

I think I need to weigh the strengths and see if any other Pokémon could perform better. For example, index 30 (Fire/Ground) has moves like Steel and Normal, which are strong, but maybe another Fire type with more powerful moves would be better.

Looking at index 18: Type Psychic/Fire. It has Max HP 160, which is high, and some good moves including Fire and Psychic attacks. This could provide a strong offensive presence.

Alternatively, index 19 (Poison/Fire) also has decent stats but maybe not as strong as others.

So perhaps the best option is to keep indices 4 and 13, which are solid, and replace 30 with someone like 18 or another Fire type that complements well.

Let me check their moves:

- Index 4: ELECTRIC/ROCK. Moves include Steel, which is great against Rock, and Electric which can be good.
- Index 13: GHOST. Has Dragon and Fairy moves, which are versatile.
- If I replace 30 with 18 (Psychic/Fire), that adds more Fire moves and some Psychic ones.

Alternatively, if I add a Water type like index 12 (Water), it would provide coverage against Water resistances, but without knowing the opponent's types, it's hard to say.

But since the last team won, maybe keeping the core of indices 4 and 13 is good. So perhaps choosing 4,13,18 or 4,13,32.

Wait, index 32 is Bug/Dragon. It has Dragon which complements Ghost's moves, and Bug can cover against Insect types if needed. Maybe that could be useful.

Alternatively, adding a Dark type for more resistances, like index 8 (Dark), but it's lower Max HP so maybe not as good.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The previous team won, so perhaps sticking with similar or slightly adjusted teams is better.

Another thought: the last result was a win, so if my Elo went up, I might want to keep the same team or make minimal changes. Maybe adding someone who's strong in a different area without sacrificing too much.

I think after considering all these factors, the best approach is to choose the previous indices 4,13,30 again because they worked last time and are strong. Unless there's a clear better option, it might be safer to stick with what's effective.

Okay, so I need to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster would maximize my chances of winning the next battle. The previous team that won had indices [4, 13, 30], and the last result was a win with an Elo update. 

First, I should look at what each Pokémon in the previous team has. Let me check their types:

- Index 4 is Electric/Rock
- Index 13 is Ghost
- Index 30 is Fire/Ground

So their types are Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Fire/Ground. These seem to cover a range of types, which is good for coverage.

Now, I need to consider the current roster and pick three Pokémon that can complement or enhance this setup. The goal is to maximize team effectiveness in battle. 

I should look at each Pokémon's type, moves, and stats to see how they might perform against common opponents or in general. Also, considering the last team won, maybe keeping similar types could be beneficial.

Looking through the roster:

- Index 2: Fire/Dragon
- Index 3: Electric/Bug
- Index 4: Electric/Rock (already used)
- Index 6: Steel
- Index 7: Ice
- Index 8: Dark
- Index 9: Ghost
- Index 10: Psychic
- Index 11: Ghost
- Index 12: Water
- Index 13: Ghost (already used)
- Index 14: Ice
- Index 15: Flying/Normal
- Index 16: Dark/Grass
- Index 17: Bug/Dragon
- Index 18: Psychic/Fire
- Index 19: Poison/Fire
- Index 20: Dragon/ Poison
- Index 21: Normal/Flying
- Index 22: Rock
- Index 23: Fire
- Index 24: Psychic/Ghost
- Index 25: Normal
- Index 26: Fairy
- Index 27: Steel
- Index 28: Grass
- Index 29: Psychic
- Index 30: Fire/Ground (already used)
- Index 31: Rock/Normal
- Index 32: Bug/Dragon
- Index 33: Flying/Water
- Index 34: Poison/Water
- Index 35: Fight
- Index 36: Dark
- Index 37: Grass
- Index 38: Water/Ghost
- Index 39: Dragon/Ground
- Index 40: Grass/Fire
- Index 41: Rock
- Index 42: Fairy/Ghost
- Index 43: Steel/Fight
- Index 44: Fairy
- Index 45: Steel
- Index 46: Rock/Steel
- Index 47: Grass
- Index 48: Dragon/Rock
- Index 49: Flying

I need to pick three that can complement the existing types or provide good coverage. The previous team had Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Fire/Ground.

Looking for possible replacements:

1. If I want to replace index 4 (Electric/Rock), maybe another Electric or Rock type could be better. Looking at indices: 3 (Electric/Bug), 6 (Steel), 14 (Ice), 20 (Dragon/ Poison), etc. Steel is a solid choice as it's versatile.

2. For Ghost, there are other Ghost types like index 9 and 11, or perhaps a Fairy/Ghost (index 42). Depending on what adds more to the team.

3. Fire/Ground is covered by index 30, which is good. Maybe replacing that with another strong Fire type? Index 23 is Fire only, but without Ground. Or index 18 is Psychic/Fire.

Alternatively, maybe adding a Dragon type for coverage could be beneficial since it's a popular type. For example, index 2 (Fire/Dragon) or index 17 (Bug/Dragon).

I also need to consider the moves and stats of each Pokémon. Higher Max HP, accuracy, and powerful moves are preferable.

Let me evaluate some candidates:

- Index 2: Fire/Dragon. Fire is good against Ghost, which was used before. Dragon can be useful against many types.
- Index 4: Already used, so not considering it again.
- Index 6: Steel. Provides coverage against Rock and Ground types.
- Index 7: Ice. Good against Grass and Water.
- Index 9: Ghost. Another Ghost type, which complements the existing one.
- Index 11: Ghost. Similar to index 13, but maybe better stats?
- Index 14: Ice. Same as index 7.
- Index 17: Bug/Dragon. Dragon again, plus Bug for Grass and Psychic.
- Index 18: Psychic/Fire. Fire is useful, and Psychic can help against Fighting types.
- Index 20: Dragon/ Poison. Dragon and Poison, both versatile.
- Index 24: Psychic/Ghost. Combines two strong types.
- Index 27: Steel. Same as index 6.
- Index 28: Grass. Good against Water and Earth types.

I think adding a Dragon type could provide good versatility. Also, considering the previous team had Electric/Rock, Ghost, and Fire/Ground, perhaps replacing one with a Dragon would add another layer of resistance or offensive strength.

Looking at indices:

- 2 (Fire/Dragon): Fire is already covered by index 30, but Dragon adds coverage.
- 17 (Bug/Dragon): Bug adds Grass resistance, which might be useful against Ground, and Dragon as before.

Alternatively, if I want to replace two types for three, maybe adding a Dragon and another type.

Wait, the user wants exactly three indices. So perhaps replacing one of the current indices with a new one plus adding two more? Or is it just choosing three from the entire list?

No, the instruction is to choose a new team of three from the roster, regardless of previous indices. So I can pick any three.

But considering that the last team was Electric/Rock, Ghost, Fire/Ground, maybe keeping similar types would be beneficial for continuity and synergy.

Looking back at my evaluation, perhaps picking:

- Steel (index 6): For coverage against Rock and Ground.
- Ghost (index 13 or 11): For Fighting and Grass resistance.
- Dragon/Fire (index 2 or 17/18/20 etc.): For versatility.

But I need to pick exactly three. Let's see:

Option 1: Steel, Ghost, Fire/Dragon.

So indices 6, 13, and 2.

Wait, but index 30 is already used as Fire/Ground. So perhaps replacing that with another Fire type or a Dragon.

Alternatively, maybe include a Fairy type for support.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the types:

- Electric/Rock: Covers Electric and Rock.
- Ghost: Covers Fighting and Grass.
- Fire/Ground: Covers Fire and Ground.

So their types cover Electric, Rock, Ghost, Fire, and Ground.

If I replace index 4 (Electric/Rock) with a Steel type, then we'd have Steel, Ghost, and Fire/Ground. That's Electric/Rock replaced by Steel, which can also cover Rock but not Electric. So maybe not as good for Electric coverage.

Alternatively, if I pick an Electric/Bug instead of index 4, keeping the coverage.

But perhaps it's better to think about the strengths of each Pokémon.

Looking at the moves and stats:

- Index 2: Fire/Dragon has high Max HP (118), decent Accuracy (0.81), and good moves including Electric and Dragon moves.
- Index 13: Ghost with 160 HP, strong moves like Dragon and Fairy, good accuracy.
- Index 30: Fire/Ground with 77 HP, which is lower but maybe more useful in certain matchups.

Wait, index 30 has low Max HP (77), but it's a Ground type, which provides resistance to Electric and Rock. Its moves include Steel and Fairy, which are strong against many types.

Alternatively, perhaps using index 6 (Steel) would provide better coverage against Rock and Ground, and have higher Max HP.

I think the key is to maximize both Type coverage and the effectiveness of their moves. Also, considering that the last result was a win, it's better to keep strategies that worked before but also improve where possible.

In the previous team [4,13,30], which are Electric/Rock, Ghost, Fire/Ground. So types covered: Electric, Rock, Ghost, Fire, Ground.

If I replace index 4 with a Steel type, we lose Electric coverage but gain more against Rock and Ground. But if the opponent has Electric-type Pokémon, we might struggle without Electric resistance.

Alternatively, if I keep index 4 (Electric/Rock), then we maintain Electric resistance. But perhaps that's not necessary if other types can cover that.

But to avoid confusion, maybe it's safer to include a Steel type for better coverage against Rock and Ground.

So possible new team: 6 (Steel), 13 (Ghost), 30 (Fire/Ground).

Wait, but index 30 is Fire/Ground. If I have Steel and Ghost, does that leave any gaps? Electric would still be covered by none, unless someone has Electric moves.

Wait, the previous team had Electric/Rock (index4) which had Electric type. So if we replace index4 with Steel, we lose Electric resistance but gain more against Rock and Ground.

But perhaps it's better to include another Electric type to maintain coverage.

Alternatively, maybe keep one of them for continuity.

This is getting complicated. I need a different approach.

Another way: look at the types needed:

- Against Grass: need either Ghost or Fairy.
- Against Water: need Ghost or Ice.
- Against Fire: need Dragon, Rock, or Ice.
- Against Electric: need Rock, Ground, or Steel.

So to cover all these, perhaps having:

- Ghost (covers Grass and Water).
- Steel (covers Electric and Rock).
- Dragon/Fire (covers Fire and some others).

But also considering Max HP, maybe higher HP is better for survivability.

Alternatively, perhaps 6 (Steel), 13 (Ghost), 2 (Fire/Dragon). So types: Steel, Ghost, Dragon. Covers:

- Steel covers Electric, Rock.
- Ghost covers Grass, Water.
- Fire/Dragon covers Fire and Dragon resistances (which include Ice, Electric, etc.).

But also, the previous team had index4 as Electric/Rock, which covers Electric, but now we don't have that, so perhaps we lose some resistance.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 6 (Steel), 13 (Ghost), 30 (Fire/Ground).

Wait, Fire/Ground can cover Ground and Fire, while Steel covers Electric and Rock. Ghost covers Grass and Water. So together:

- Steel: Electric, Rock.
- Ghost: Grass, Water.
- Fire/Ground: Fire, Ground.

That seems comprehensive.

Alternatively, 6 (Steel), 13 (Ghost), 2 (Fire/Dragon).

But 2 is Fire/Dragon which can cover Fire and Dragon resistances. But without a Ground type, unless someone has Ground moves.

Wait, the team needs to have types that are effective against each other as well. For example, Electric is weak against Water, Rock, etc.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the best approach is to pick the top 3 Pokémon with the highest Max HP and strong move sets.

Looking at the Roster:

Max HPs: 160 (several), 138 (4,13,18,28, etc.), 134, 129, 148, etc.

So let's list them by Max HP descending:

- 160: several indices like 0, 13, 18, 41,43,45,46,48
- 158: none?
Wait, checking the Roster:

Looking at each PkmTemplate's Max_HP:

Looking through the Roster, the highest Max_HP is 160.

So the top HPs are around there. So picking from them might be better for survivability.

Then, looking for strong move sets. For example, index13: Ghost with high HP (160), good moves including Dragon and Fairy.

Index4: Electric/Rock with 137 HP, which isn't as high but has useful moves like Steel.

But if I'm focusing on higher HP, maybe pick index13, then another high HP, say index18 (160). Wait, what's index18? PkmTemplate Type=PSYCHIC/FIRE, Max_HP=160. Moves include Grass and Fire, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps combining high HP with good type coverage.

Wait, but the previous team was [4,13,30]. They had Electric/Rock (4), Ghost (13), and Fire/Ground (30). They won last time.

So maybe continue that strategy but tweak for better effectiveness.

Perhaps replacing index4 with a different Electric or Rock type, or another type that provides good coverage.

Alternatively, if we keep the same team [4,13,30], but I don't know if it's allowed to reuse previous indices. The instructions say "choose a new 3-Pokémon team from the Roster." So I think new doesn't mean unique, just select three again, possibly including previous ones.

But perhaps the algorithm should consider what worked before and improve upon it.

In any case, given the time constraints, I'll make an educated guess based on the previous team's types and look for similar coverage with higher HP if possible.

So, keeping Ghost (13), Fire/Ground (30) seems good. Then maybe another high HP type like Steel or Rock.

Looking at index6: Type=ROCK, Max_HP=109. Not as high as others but has useful moves.

Alternatively, index41: Type=ROCK, Max_HP=160. That's a higher HP and solid coverage.

So perhaps team [13,30,41].

Wait, let me check their types:

- 13: Ghost
- 30: Fire/Ground
- 41: Rock

Type coverage:

- Ghost covers Grass and Water.
- Fire/Ground covers Fire and Ground (which also resists Electric).
- Rock covers Electric and Rock.

That's pretty solid. Plus, both 13 and 41 have high Max_HP (160 and 160), which is good for survivability.

Alternatively, if I include a Steel type instead of Rock, maybe that would cover more types like Electric and some others.

Looking at index6: Type=ROCK, but perhaps index41 or another Steel type. Wait, index45 is Dark/GRASS? No, 46 is ROCK/STEEL with Max_HP=160.

So team [13,30,46].

46: Rock/Steel, which covers Electric (because Steel resists Electric), Rock (covers Rock), and Steel covers Electric as well.

So types covered:

- Ghost: Grass, Water.
- Fire/Ground: Fire, Ground (which also resist Electric).
- Rock/Steel: Electric, Rock, some others.

That seems good. Plus, both 13 and 46 have high HP (160 each), and 30 has decent HP (77).

Alternatively, perhaps index48 is Dragon/Rock with Max_HP=126. Maybe that's a better choice than Rock alone because of the Dragon type which can be useful against certain opponents.

But I'm not sure about the specific matchups.

In any case, among the available options, [13,30,46] seems to provide good coverage with high HP and useful types.

Alright, so I'm trying to help someone build a Pokémon team based on some given data. Let me break down what's happening here.

First, the user provided a scenario where they're part of a simplified Pokémon version. They need to create a new 3-Pokémon team from a roster each time, using only specific information: Roster, Previous Team, and Last Result. The goal is to maximize their chances in the next battle.

In this case, the previous battle was their first one, so there's no prior result or winning data. The Roster includes 50 different Pokémon templates with various types, Max_HP, and Moves. Each template has specific attributes that could affect battles, like type effectiveness, move accuracy, and power.

Since it's the user's first battle, they probably don't have any established teams or strategies. Their main focus should be on creating a balanced team that can handle a variety of opponents. They might not know which types are strong against others, so they need to pick Pokémon that cover multiple types and have good stats for general use.

Looking at the Roster, I notice there's a lot of variety in types: Electric, Grass, Water, Fire, Dark, etc. It would be smart to include a mix of types that can cover each other's weaknesses. For example, having an Electric type might help against Water and Ground types, while a Fighting or Rock type could provide physical resistance.

Another factor is the Moveset of each Pokémon. Moves with high accuracy, good power, and coverage are valuable. Some moves have unique effects like Tailwind or Light Screen which can boost the team's effectiveness.

Also, considering Max_HP is important because higher HP means better survivability, especially against powerful moves. However, it's a balance because some types might need higher HP to function effectively.

Since they're starting fresh, maybe selecting strong, versatile Pokémon with good stats would be ideal. Types like Electric, Grass, and Rock are usually solid choices because of their versatility in different environments.

Looking at the specific templates provided, I should pick the ones that have a balance of high HP, effective moves, and useful types. For example, PkmTemplate 1 is Electric/Steel with decent Max_HP and some powerful moves. This type combination is strong against both Water and Steel, which are common in the Roster.

Another consideration is avoiding too many redundant types. Having three different types ensures that they can cover more scenarios in a battle. So, maybe one Electric, one Grass, and one Rock type would be beneficial as they each have strong resistances and coverage.

I also need to make sure that the chosen templates have moves that are effective against each other. For instance, having a Rock move that can break through certain types while also being resistant to others.

In terms of movesets, I'm looking for moves with high accuracy or high power because those are more reliable in battles. Moves like Electric attacks can be very strong against Water and Ground types, which are common, so having multiple Electric or dual-type Pokémon could be advantageous.

Finally, since it's their first battle, they might not have any specific opponents to counter, so a team with good all-around stats and type coverage is the way to go. It allows them to adapt better in different situations without relying on specific knowledge of the opponent.

After evaluating all this, I think selecting three Pokémon that cover diverse types, have high HP, and effective moves will give them the best chance in their first battle.

Okay, so I need to choose a new Pokémon team from the given roster after my last team lost. The goal is to maximize chances in the next battle. Let's start by analyzing the information provided.

First, the last result says "Your last team lost. Your new Elo is 1185.00." This means that the previous team didn't perform well and I need to pick a better combination this time. Also, there's no prior winning data available, so I don't have any past successes to reference for team composition.

The previous team used indices [0, 1, 14]. Let me check what those Pokémon are:

- Index 0: Type ELECTRIC/STEEL with Max_HP 102 and various moves.
- Index 1: Type GRASS/WATER with Max_HP 112.
- Index 14: Type WATER with Max_HP 122.

Looking at their types, the previous team had Electric/Steel (Electric), Grass/Water (Water), and Water. So types used were primarily Electric, Water, and a bit of Grass. The last loss might indicate that these types weren't effective against whatever was used before or perhaps had some weaknesses exploited by the opposing Pokémon.

Now, I need to choose three new Pokémon from the roster. My goal is to pick a team that can potentially counter whatever type advantages the opponent has while also having strong offensive and defensive capabilities.

Let me look through the roster:

I see several high HP options, which could be beneficial for defense. Also, considering types that are versatile and have good coverage would be useful. Maybe picking Pokémon with moves that can exploit common weaknesses or have strong priority moves.

Looking at the available indices:

- 0: Electric/Steel
- 1: Grass/Water
- 14: Water
- Others: I see several FLYING, WATER, GRASS, GHOST, etc.

Maybe avoiding the same types as before to avoid repetition. The previous team had a lot of Water and Electric, so perhaps switching to different typings like Fire, Ice, or Dragon could be beneficial.

Wait, but maybe not overcomplicating. Let's look for strong individual Pokémon.

Looking at index 16: Type FAIRY/ELECTRIC with Max_HP 148. That seems powerful.
Index 26: ROCK/DARK, HP 153. Strong physical attacker.
Index 29: FIRE/DARK, HP 160. Fire and Dark could be good offensive types.

Alternatively, maybe a mix of strong attackers and supportive Pokémon.

Wait, the previous team was Electric/Steel, Grass/Water, Water. So they covered multiple types but perhaps didn't have the best individual picks.

Looking for high HP, good moves, and versatile types:

- Index 19: GHOST, Max_HP 160. Ghost can resist many statuses, which is useful.
- Index 20: GRASS, Max_HP 116. Grass has nice move sets sometimes.
- Index 34: FIRE/FLYING, Max_HP 135. Fire can be good for coverage, and Flying is versatile.

Wait, but maybe I should pick the best three in terms of overall power and type coverage.

Looking at Max HP:

The highest HPs are around 160 (indices 19, 20, 28, 29, etc.). Maybe choosing from those could help with defense.

Type-wise, it's good to have a mix. Electric/Steel is good for both offense and defense, Grass can cover ground and grass types, and maybe another type like Ice or Dark for versatility.

Alternatively, having a Ghost type could be great for status resistance.

Hmm, perhaps selecting:

- 19: GHOST (high HP, resistances)
- 26: ROCK/DARK (physical attacker with good moves)
- 34: FIRE/FLYING (offensive and versatile)

But wait, maybe I should look at the move sets to see what's strong.

Looking back, for example:

Index 0: Electric/Steel. Moves include Flying, Toxic, Rock, etc. Good all-rounder.
Index 1: Grass/Water. Strong water moves and grass coverage.
Index14: Water. Solid water type with high HP.

But since the last team lost, maybe they were outmatched in some way. So perhaps switching to types that are strong against common opponents or have strong individual presences.

Another approach is to pick the top three highest HP Pokémon regardless of type, as they can better sustain battles.

Looking through:

- 19:160
- 20:116
- 28:108
- 29:160
- 34:135
- 38:145

So, perhaps selecting 19 (GHOST), 29 (FIRE/DARK), and another high HP.

Alternatively, maybe a balance of high HP and strong types.

Wait, but the user wants three indices, so let me see:

Looking at the move sets for some high HP Pokémon:

- Index 16: FAIRY/ELECTRIC with good moves like Trickroom.
- Index 19: GHOST with Protect and other useful moves.
- Index 29: FIRE/DARK with nice moves like Sun, Reflect.

Maybe combining these would be a strong team.

Alternatively, looking at the types that are hard to counter, like Dragon or Ice.

Wait, perhaps it's better to pick Pokémon that have both high HP and strong move sets.

Looking at index 16: FAIRY/ELECTRIC. Electric is good for switching out with STAB moves, and Fairy can be useful against certain opponents.

Index 19: GHOST has great HP and status resistance, which is always helpful.

Index 29: FIRE/DARK. Fire can cover many types, and Dark adds another layer of resistance.

Alternatively, maybe picking a mix of types that can cover Electric, Water, Grass, etc.

But perhaps the best approach is to pick the three with the highest Max_HP, as they can better survive in battles.

Looking at Max HP:

- 19:160
- 29:160
- 34:135
- 35:148

So 19 and 29 are tied for highest. Maybe picking those two plus another strong one.

Alternatively, maybe 19 (GHOST), 29 (FIRE/DARK), and 26 (ROCK/DARK). That gives a good mix of types and high HPs.

But I need to ensure that the team is balanced and covers multiple types.

Wait, perhaps 16 (FAIRY/ELECTRIC), 19 (GHOST), and 29 (FIRE/DARK) would be a solid choice. Fairy can handle Electric, Ghost adds status resistance, Fire provides good offensive coverage.

Alternatively, considering the previous team had Water, maybe adding another strong Water type to counter any Water-based opponents.

But I think it's better to have a versatile team that can adapt.

Another thought: index 0 is Electric/Steel, which was part of the last team and perhaps contributed to the loss. Maybe replacing it with a different type could help.

So, possible new team:

- 19: GHOST
- 29: FIRE/DARK
- 16: FAIRY/ELECTRIC

This gives a mix of types, high HPs, and useful moves like Trickroom (from 16), Protect and status resistance (from 19), and Sun/Reflect/Fire moves (from 29).

Alternatively, maybe including a strong Rock type could be beneficial against Ground or other types.

Wait, index 26: ROCK/DARK. That's another high HP with good moves.

So perhaps 19, 26, and 29 would be even better due to their high HP and type coverage.

I think that's a plausible team. Let me check:

- GHOST (19): High HP, status resistance.
- ROCK/DARK (26): Physical attacker with good moves.
- FIRE/DARK (29): Strong offensive presence with Fire and Dark types.

This seems balanced with good individual Pokémon and type coverage.

Another consideration: the last team lost, so maybe the opponent had certain types that were strong against them. If I can infer that, I might adjust accordingly. But without knowing the exact opposing types, it's hard to tailor specifically.

In conclusion, selecting indices 19, 26, and 29 seems like a good choice based on high HP, type versatility, and strong move sets.

Okay, so I need to figure out a new Pokémon team that can help me win the next battle. The last time I played, my team won, and I have some information about previous teams and rosters to base my decision on.

First, let's look at what I know. My last three indices were 19, 26, and 29. These correspond to specific Pokémon templates with their types, max HP, and moves. The fact that my team won suggests that these Pokémon performed well in the previous battle. Now, I need to choose a new set of three Pokémon from the roster that can maximize my chances next time.

Looking at the current roster, there are 49 Pokémon available. Each has their own type, max HP, and a list of moves with details like power, accuracy, PP, etc. My goal is to pick three that will complement each other in terms of types, strengths, and coverage against possible opponents.

I should consider the types of my previous team: index 19 is Ghost, 26 is Rock/Dark, and 29 is Fire/Dark. So, my last team had Ghost, Rock/Dark, and Fire/Dark. That covers a good range of types, including Ground, Fire, Dark, and Ghost.

Now, I need to find three Pokémon that can cover these types effectively or provide advantages in certain areas. Maybe I should look for a mix of offense, defense, and supportive roles. Also, considering the moves each Pokémon has will help in ensuring they can take down opponents effectively.

Looking through the roster:

- Type coverage: Electric, Grass, Water, Fire, Dark, Rock, Ice, etc.
- High HP: Some have up to 160 max HP, which is good for taking hits.
- Effective moves: Moves that have high power, accuracy, or good PP can be very useful.

I should also think about the last result. Since my team won, I probably used some strong moves that overpowered the opponents. Maybe focusing on moves that can deal high damage or have modifiers that boost attack or defense.

Let's consider each Pokémon:

- Index 14: Water. It has Fly, which is a good attacker. Also, Ground and Dark resistances might be useful.
- Index 30: Flying. It has Electric and Normal moves, which are versatile. High HP could help in surviving battles.
- Index 49: Fight. It's a physical type with good attack, which can take down opponents effectively.

So, putting these together:

- Water (14) can cover Ground and Dark types, and Fly is a strong attacker.
- Flying (30) provides Electric and Normal coverage, which are solid defensive types.
- Fight (49) is a strong physical attacker that can handle multiple threats.

This combination seems balanced with good type coverage, high HP for endurance, and strong attacking moves. It should be effective against various opponents, giving me a good chance of winning the next battle.

Alright, I need to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team after my last loss. The previous team had indices [14, 30, 49], but they lost. My Elo dropped, so I want to improve this time.

First, looking at the Roster, there are 50 templates, each with Type, Max_HP, and Moves. Since it's a simplified Pokémon game, I don't know the exact mechanics, but I can infer that certain types might be better against others based on common strengths and weaknesses.

My last team used indices 14, 30, and 49. Let me check those:

- **14**: Water type with Max HP 122. It has moves like Flying (which is good for coverage) and Change Type, which can switch the type effectively.
- **30**: FLYING type with Max HP 100. It has Electric-type moves and Normal, which are solid.
- **49**: FIGHT type with Max HP 74. It's a physical attacker with strong moves like Rock and Power 71.

But they lost, so maybe their composition wasn't optimal. I need to find three Pokémon that can cover different types and have good moves for coverage.

I should consider the previous winning teams, which were [19, 26, 29]. Let me see what those are:

- **19**: Ghost type with high HP (160). It has Water moves, which might be useful against Grass or Fire.
- **26**: Rock/Dark type with high Max HP (153). It has Poison and Flying moves, which can deal damage and have good coverage.
- **29**: Fire/Dark type with Max HP 160. It has Steel moves, which are strong against Rock.

Hmm, these types cover a mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. Maybe I should aim for similar synergy.

Looking at the Roster again, I need to find three Pokémon that can support each other, maybe covering multiple types like Electric, Flying, and Ground, or something else effective.

Let me look for high HP templates with strong moves. Higher Max HP usually means better survival in battles. So I should prioritize those.

Starting from index 0: Electric/Steel with Max HP 102. It has Flying and Psychic moves, which are good, but Steel is a solid type.

Index 7: Electric type with Max HP 138. It has Rock and Ghost moves, which can be useful against Ground and Psychic.

Index 18: Fairy/Psychic with Max HP 160. This has strong moves like Fire and Power 86, which could be good for coverage.

Wait, but I need three. Let me check indices 19, 26, 29 again. They are Ghost, Rock/Dark, Fire/Dark. That's a good mix of types—Ghost can handle Psychic and Ground, Rock deals with Ground and Electric, Fire can cover Fire-type opponents.

But my last team lost with [14,30,49], which were Water, Flying, Fight. Maybe I need to replace them with something more effective.

Looking for high HP and strong moves, perhaps:

- **19**: Ghost (160 HP) – good for late-game support.
- **26**: Rock/Dark (153 HP) – can handle multiple types and has powerful moves.
- **29**: Fire/Dark (160 HP) – great attacker with Steel moves.

Alternatively, maybe using Electric/Steel (0), Grass (20 or 28), and another type.

Wait, but I should focus on what worked before. The previous winning team used Ghost, Rock/Dark, Fire/Dark. Maybe I can use similar indices.

Looking at the Roster:

- **19**: Ghost
- **26**: Rock/Dark
- **29**: Fire/Dark

These seem like strong choices. They cover different types and have good HP and moves.

Alternatively, maybe using Electric/Steel (0), Grass (20 or 28), and something else. Let me check the indices again.

I think sticking with high HP and strong move sets is better for survivability. So 19,26,29 might be a solid choice.

Okay, so I need to figure out which three Pokémon from the given roster should be chosen as the next team. The previous team won with indices [19, 26, 29], and the last result was a win with an Elo of 1197.18. 

First, I should look at what each of these Pokémon are. Let me check their types:

- Index 19: Ghost
- Index 26: Rock/Dark
- Index 29: Fire/Dark

So their types were Ghost, Rock/Dark, and Fire/Dark. They must have worked well together in the previous battle.

Now, to choose a new team, I should consider which Pokémon might complement each other in terms of type coverage and stats. Maybe look for types that are strong against the types they might be facing next, or maybe just balance the team with different strengths.

Looking at the roster, I need to pick three that aren't necessarily the same as before but can synergize. Let me go through some candidates:

- Index 0: Electric/Steel – Steel is good for defense and can cover Electric types.
- Index 1: Grass/Water – Water and Grass coverage.
- Index 2: Flying/Ice – Adds Air Defense and Ice coverage.
- Index 3: Steel/Poison – Good for both offense and defense.
- Index 4: Ice – Single type, but maybe useful for specific battles.
- Index 5: Ice/Poison – Combines two types that can be useful against various opponents.
- Index 6: Ghost/Fight – Ghost is good for Fighting moves and has good defensive stats.
- Index 7: Electric – Strong offensive type with good stats.
- Index 8: Ghost – Another Ghost, could add more versatility.
- Index 9: Water/Normal – Water can be useful in water battles.
- Index 10: Electric – Similar to index 7 but perhaps different moves.
- Index 11: Flying – Good for Air Defense and offensive flying moves.
- Index 12: Fairy – Adds Fairy type, which is good against Dragon types.
- Index 13: Bug/Steel – Steel again for defense and Bug for bug-type attacks.
- Index 14: Water – Another water type, but maybe less useful than Grass/Water.
- Index 15: Dragon – Good against Fairy and Ice types.
- Index 16: Fairy/Electric – Combines both types, which can be versatile.
- Index 17: Dark/Poison – Good for offensive moves and poison effects.
- Index 18: Fairy/Psychic – Adds both Fairy and Psychic types.
- Index 19: Ghost – Same as before but could be useful in certain matchups.
- Index 20: Grass – Strong against Bug, Fire, Ice, etc.
- Index 21: Ground – Good for terrain moves like Sand or Rock.
- Index 22: Psychic/Fairy – Useful for special attacks and fairy types.
- Index 23: Electric/Bug – Combines two useful offensive types.
- Index 24: Normal – Basic type with good PP but maybe not the best.
- Index 25: Dragon/Psychic – Good against certain types, strong moves.
- Index 26: Rock/Dark – Same as before, part of the previous team.
- Index 27: Ghost – Another Ghost, could be useful for different strategies.
- Index 28: Grass – Similar to index 1 but perhaps different stats.
- Index 29: Fire/Dark – Part of the previous team.
- Index 30: Flying – Same as index 2 but maybe better stats or moves.
- Index 31: Ghost – Another Ghost, possibly for more versatility.
- Index 32: Psychic – Strong special attacks and good PP.
- Index 33: Water – Similar to index 14 but with different stats.
- Index 34: Fire/Flying – Combines Fire and Flying, which could be useful.
- Index 35: Rock – Good for physical attacks and defense.
- Index 36: Ghost – Another Ghost type, maybe for specific uses.
- Index 37: Poison/Water – Adds both poison and water types.
- Index 38: Bug/Dark – Combines Bug and Dark, which can be strong offensively.
- Index 39: Ground – Similar to index 21 but with different stats.
- Index 40: Fight – Strong physical moves and good PP.
- Index 41: Steel – Good for defense and steel-type attacks.
- Index 42: Psychic/Grass – Combines two versatile types.
- Index 43: Steel/Rock – Strong defensive and offensive capabilities.
- Index 44: Ice – Single type but useful against Fire and Grass.
- Index 45: Dark – Good for offensive moves and dark type advantages.
- Index 46: Bug – Adds bug-type attacks, which can be strong against Grass.
- Index 47: Grass – Similar to index 20 but different stats.
- Index 48: Fairy – Strong against Dragon types, good PP.
- Index 49: Fight – Same as index 40 but with lower HP.

Now, considering the previous team was Ghost (19), Rock/Dark (26), Fire/Dark (29). So their types covered a lot of offensive options and some defensive. For the new team, I need to pick three that can complement each other.

Looking for types that are strong against common opponents or have good synergy. Maybe include Electric/Steel (0) because Steel is resilient and Electric adds offensive power. Then maybe another type like Water/Normal (9) which could help with water battles and normal moves. And perhaps a Fighting type (40) for physical attacks and good PP.

Wait, but the previous team already had Dark types, so adding more might not be necessary unless it's beneficial. Alternatively, adding a Ghost or Steel again could provide defensive boost. Let me see:

- Index 0: Electric/Steel – Provides Steel defense and Electric attacks.
- Index 1: Grass/Water – Provides Water for water battles and Grass coverage.
- Index 4: Ice – Adds Ice type which is strong against Fire and Grass.

This team would have Electric/Steel, Grass/Water, and Ice. The types cover a wide range of possibilities. Electric can handle Electric opponents, Steel provides good defense, Grass covers ground moves and grass types, Water for water battles, and Ice for ice-specific scenarios. Plus, their Max HPs are decent: 102, 112, and 83.

Alternatively, maybe picking index 0 (Electric/Steel), index 20 (Grass), and index 32 (Psychic). But not sure if that's better.

Wait, the previous team won with Ghost, Rock/Dark, Fire/Dark. So they had a lot of offensive power and good defensive moves. Maybe for the next team, I should focus on types that can handle a variety of enemies, perhaps with more defensive capabilities.

Looking at index 0: Electric/Steel – Steel is great for defense, and Electric adds strong offensive moves. Index 1: Grass/Water – Water is useful in water battles, and Grass covers a lot of ground moves. Index 3: Steel/Poison – Another Steel type, which would add more defensive power and offensive poison moves.

So team with indices 0 (Electric/Steel), 1 (Grass/Water), 3 (Steel/Poison). This gives two Steel types for great defense and two offensive types in Electric and Grass. Plus, Poison adds some surprise attacks.

Alternatively, maybe include a Ghost type for more versatility, but the previous team already had one. Maybe it's better to have different types this time.

Wait, the user’s instruction is to return three indices based on the given roster. The previous team won with [19,26,29], which are all high HP and strong offensive moves. So maybe pick similar high-Hp, strong types but not necessarily the same types.

Looking at index 0: Electric/Steel – High Max HP (102), good PP in some moves, and both Electric and Steel types. That's a solid choice.

Index 2: Flying/Ice – High Max HP (114), has good moves like Fly, which can be useful for escaping or dealing damage from the air.

Index 4: Ice – While lower HP at 83, it has strong moves like Heal 0.01 and Rock, which can be useful in specific battles.

So team with 0,2,4: Electric/Steel, Flying/Ice, Ice. This covers multiple types and provides both offensive and defensive capabilities. Plus, the Max HPs are decent for their respective roles.

Alternatively, index 0,1,3: Electric/Steel, Grass/Water, Steel/Poison. Two Steels for defense, Grass for ground moves, Water for water battles, and Poison for surprise attacks.

Hmm, it's a bit tricky to decide which combination is better. Maybe I should look at the previous team's types: Ghost, Rock/Dark, Fire/Dark. So their team had two Dark/Black type, one Ghost, so maybe avoid too many of those unless necessary.

So perhaps picking Electric/Steel (0), Grass/Water (1), and Ice (4) would be a good mix because they cover multiple elements without overlapping types much.

But the user's last result was a win with Elo 1197.18. Maybe including higher Max HPs is better for durability, so indices 0,1,3 have higher HP than 0,2,4.

Alternatively, maybe focus on high HP and strong moves. Let me see:

Index 3: Steel/Poison – HP 130, good moves like Ground, which can be useful against Ground types.

Index 20: Grass – HP 116, good PP in some moves.

Index 32: Psychic/Grass – HP 159, which is quite high and has strong moves like Water, Light Screen, etc.

So team with 3,20,32: Steel/Poison, Grass, Psychic/Grass. This gives a mix of types and high Max HPs. But I'm not sure if that's better than other options.

Alternatively, maybe include a Fighting type for physical attacks. Index 40 has HP 109 and strong moves like Normal, Rock, etc.

So team with 0 (Electric/Steel), 1 (Grass/Water), 40 (Fight). That would give Electric/Steel (defense) + Grass/Water (diverse coverage) + Fighting (physical damage).

But I need to make sure the combination is balanced. Maybe the best approach is to pick the three highest Max HPs with good moves.

Looking at the roster, the highest HP is 160 (index 19,26,28, etc.), but the user's previous team already had some high HP ones. So maybe choose lower but still high HP.

Alternatively, perhaps focus on specific types that are strong against each other or have synergistic effects.

Wait, Electric/Steel (0), Grass/Water (1), and Ice (4) – these can cover a lot of type matchups. Electric vs. Steel is good for Electric attacks on Steel, but Steel resists Electric. Wait, no, Electric is weak to Ground, but strong against Water and other types.

Grass covers Ground and Water, while Ice is strong against Fire and Grass.

So in a battle, having Electric/Steel to handle Electric enemies, Grass/Water to cover Water and Ground, and Ice to counter Fire and Grass. This seems like a balanced team with good coverage.

Also, their Max HPs are 102 (0), 112 (1), and 83 (4). That's decent for a mix of higher and medium HP.

Another option is indices 3,19,26: Steel/Poison, Ghost, Rock/Dark. This would give good defensive types like Steel and Ghost, plus Rock/Dark for offensive and type coverage.

But since the previous team had a Ghost (index 19), maybe avoiding duplicates unless necessary.

Hmm, it's a bit challenging. Maybe I should go with indices that have strong moves and high HP.

Looking at index 0: Electric/Steel – good all-rounder.

Index 1: Grass/Water – versatile.

Index 4: Ice – useful against Fire and Grass.

So team 0,1,4 seems like a solid choice. They cover multiple types and have decent Max HPs.

Alternatively, if I want more offensive power, maybe include higher HP indices like 3 (130), 26 (153), 29 (160). But that might be too much for one battle unless the opponents are specific types.

But considering the previous team had a win, maybe keeping some similar strong types is good. So perhaps picking 3 (Steel/Poison), 26 (Rock/Dark), and 29 (Fire/Dark). That gives a mix of Steel, Rock, Fire, Dark, and Poison. But I'm not sure if that's better than other combinations.

Wait, the user's last result was a win with Elo over 1197, so maybe the team performed well before. To maintain consistency, perhaps sticking with similar types but different indices could be good.

Alternatively, to switch up, maybe go for more balanced types rather than too many offensive or defensive ones.

I think I've thought through enough. I'll go with indices 0,1,4 as a balanced and versatile team.

Alright, I need to figure out how to choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. The user provided a list of Pokémon templates along with their types, Max HP, and moves. My task is to pick three Pokémon from this roster that will maximize my chances in the next battle.

First, let me understand what's given:

- **Last Result**: "Your last team lost. Your new Elo is 1181.94." This means I need to avoid whatever strategies or Pokémon that led to the loss. So I should look for strengths where my previous team was weak.

- **Previous Team**: Indices [0, 1, 4]. Let me check what those Pokémon are:
  - Index 0: Type ELECTRIC/STEEL, Max HP 102.
  - Index 1: Type GRASS/WATER, Max HP 112.
  - Index 4: Type ICE, Max HP 83.

So the previous team had a mix of Electric/Steel, Grass/Water, and Ice types. Since they lost, maybe their moves or typings didn't perform well against the opposing team's types.

My goal is to pick the next team that complements each other, covers multiple types effectively, and has strong moves that can exploit weaknesses.

Looking at the roster, I need to analyze which Pokémon could synergize well. Let me consider the strengths of each type:

- **Electric/Steel (0)**: Good coverage against many types, especially Ground and Rock.
- **Grass/Water (1)**: Covers Grass and Water, which can be good for dual typings.
- **Ice (4)**: Effective against Ice types, but maybe not as versatile.

Since the last team lost, perhaps the opposing team had strong moves that countered them. So I need to pick Pokémon with moves that can counter common attacking types or have strong counters.

Looking at the available indices:

I should avoid picking Pokémon from the same type group if possible unless they have unique strengths. For example, having a Rock type could be good against many others, but maybe it's better to focus on types that are currently in demand.

Let me go through each index and evaluate their potential:

- **Index 2**: FLYING/ICE. Flying is versatile, Ice can handle Grass and Water.
- **Index 3**: STEEL/POISON. Steel is strong against Rock, Poison is good for defense.
- **Index 5**: ICE/POISON. Good defensive moves, but maybe not offensive enough.
- **Index 6**: GHOST/FIGHT. Ghost is good against Normal and Dark, Fight can be useful in combat.
- **Index 7**: ELECTRIC. Strong against Ground and Rock, but only one type here.
- **Index 8**: GHOST. Good for Normal and Dark, but not as strong alone.
- **Index 9**: WATER/NORMAL. Can handle Water and Normal, which are common types.
- **Index 10**: ELECTRIC. Similar to index 7, good against Ground and Rock.
- **Index 11**: FLYING. Versatile, can be used for various purposes.
- **Index 12**: FAIRY. Good against Dark and Fire, but limited use otherwise.
- **Index 13**: BUG/STEEL. Steel is strong, Bug can handle Grass and Ground.
- **Index 14**: WATER. Good for Water and Normal, similar to index 9.
- **Index 15**: DRAGON. Not as versatile, but can be useful against Dragon types.
- **Index 16**: FAIRY/ELECTRIC. Fairy is good against Dark and Fire; Electric is strong.
- **Index 17**: DARK/POISON. Good for Poison and Dark, which are defensive.
- **Index 18**: FAIRY/PSYCHIC. Combines Fairy and Psychic, which can handle multiple types.
- **Index 19**: GHOST. Similar to index 6, good against Normal and Dark.
- **Index 20**: GRASS. Good for Grass and Electric, but limited.
- **Index 21**: GROUND. Strong against Air, but maybe not as useful otherwise.
- **Index 22**: PSYCHIC/FAIRY. Psychic covers many types, Fairy adds more versatility.
- **Index 23**: ELECTRIC/BUG. Electric is strong; Bug handles Grass and Ground.
- **Index 24**: NORMAL. Basic type, might be less useful unless needed.
- **Index 25**: DRAGON/PSYCHIC. Similar to index 15, but with Psychic for more versatility.
- **Index 26**: ROCK/DARK. Rock is strong against many types; Dark adds defense.
- **Index 27**: GHOST. Same as before, good against Normal and Dark.
- **Index 28**: GRASS. Similar to index 20, not as versatile.
- **Index 29**: FIRE/DARK. Fire can be useful, but might not cover enough types.
- **Index 30**: FLYING. Versatile again, similar to index 11.
- **Index 31**: GHOST. Again, good against Normal and Dark.
- **Index 32**: PSYCHIC. Strong for many types, especially Psychic ones.
- **Index 33**: WATER. Similar to indices 9 and 14.
- **Index 34**: FIRE/FLYING. Fire can be useful, Flying adds versatility.
- **Index 35**: ROCK. Strong against Rock, but maybe not as versatile.
- **Index 36**: GHOST. Same as others, good against Normal and Dark.
- **Index 37**: POISON/WATER. Good for Water and Poison, similar to index 14.
- **Index 38**: BUG/DARK. Bug is good; Dark adds defense.
- **Index 39**: GROUND. Similar to index 21, not as useful.
- **Index 40**: FIGHT. Basic, might be less effective unless needed for specific moves.
- **Index 41**: STEEL. Strong against Rock and Ground, but only one type here.
- **Index 42**: PSYCHIC/GRASS. Similar to index 32, with Grass added.
- **Index 43**: STEEL/ROCK. Steel is strong; Rock adds more coverage.
- **Index 44**: ICE. Good against Fire, Water, and Electric, but maybe not enough.
- **Index 45**: DARK. Good for Dark types, but limited on its own.
- **Index 46**: BUG. Similar to index 23, but only Bug.
- **Index 47**: GRASS. Similar to indices 20 and 28, not as versatile.
- **Index 48**: FAIRY. Same as others, good against Dark and Fire.
- **Index 49**: FIGHT. Similar to index 40, basic.

Now, I need to pick three that can cover multiple types effectively, have strong moves, and avoid the weaknesses from the previous loss.

Looking at the last result, since they lost, their team might have been weak against certain types or moves. So perhaps the new team should focus on types that are strong against what the previous team was weak at.

But without knowing exactly what the opposing team used before, it's a bit tricky. However, I can infer that maybe the last team had types that were easily countered.

Looking back at the previous team: Electric/Steel, Grass/Water, Ice. If they lost, perhaps their moves didn't counter certain types effectively. Maybe the new team should have types that are strong against common attacking types or have strong counters.

Alternatively, I can look for Pokémon with strong defensive moves or high accuracy, which can survive longer in battles.

Also, considering Max HP is part of each template, higher Max HP usually means better survivability.

Let me now try to pick three indices:

1. **Index 26**: ROCK/DARK. Rock covers many types like Ground and Steel. Dark is good against Psychic and Fighting. This Pokémon has a strong type coverage and high Max HP (153), making it a solid choice for defense and offense.

2. **Index 32**: PSYCHIC. Psychic is versatile, covering many types like Water, Fire, Earth, Air, and more. This can help in different situations. It also has decent Max HP (159). Psychic also resists many attacks, which is a plus.

3. **Index 33**: WATER. Water is good against Fire and Ground. Combined with Normal, it's useful. High Max HP (119) helps in surviving battles. Plus, it can have moves like Water Pulse or Hydro Pump for strong attacks.

Wait, but index 32 is a single type, which might limit its versatility compared to others that are dual types. But the advantage of being single-type is stronger coverage against specific types.

Alternatively, maybe I should pick more dual types for better adaptability.

Another approach: choose high Max HP with good defensive moves or strong attacking capabilities.

Looking at index 18: FAIRY/PSYCHIC (160 HP) which is a strong type combination. It can have moves like Psycho Cut and Fairy-type attacks, which are strong against Psychic and Fighting types respectively. But I'm not sure if the last team's loss would make this better or worse.

Wait, the last result was a loss with Elo 1181.94. So perhaps the previous team had some weaknesses that need to be addressed.

Given that, maybe picking types that counter common attacking types would help. For example, if the opposing team used many Fire-type attacks, choosing Water and Electric could be beneficial.

Looking at index 30: FLYING (100 HP). Flying is strong against Ground and Steel. It also has moves like Thunderbolt for Electric attacks. High Max HP with decent offensive moves.

Alternatively, index 29: FIRE/DARK (160 HP) which can burn through Grass and Water types. Fire is strong against Grass and Water, Dark helps against Psychic and Fighting. But if the last team lost due to weakness against Fire, this might not be ideal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to pick Pokémon that have moves with high accuracy or wide coverage.

Looking at index 14: WATER (122 HP). Water is good against Fire and Grass. It also has moves like Hydro Pump for strong attacks. High Max HP with decent defense.

But maybe combining Water with another type could be better. Alternatively, choosing a single-type Pokémon that's strong in multiple aspects.

Another thought: index 32 is PSYCHIC (159 HP). Psychic can take down many types and has good defensive capabilities. It might help in surviving longer battles, which is crucial for maintaining team composition.

So, considering all this, I think the best choices are:

- **26**: ROCK/DARK for strong type coverage and high defense.
- **32**: PSYCHIC for versatility and durability.
- **30**: FLYING for coverage against Ground/Steel and Electric attacks with Thunderbolt.

Alternatively, could replace 30 with another type. But I think these three cover a good range of types and have decent stats to handle battles.

Okay, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on their previous performance and the available roster. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user's last team lost, and their Elo is now 1165.39. Their previous winning team had indices 19, 26, 29. Now, they have to select three Pokémon from the given roster to maximize their chances in the next battle.

First, I should look at what the user has provided. They've given a detailed list of each Pokémon's type, max HP, and moves. The previous team used indices [26, 32, 30], which correspond to Rock/Dark, Ghost, and Flying Pokémon respectively. Since their last team lost, they might need to adjust their team composition.

I remember that in Pokémon battles, having a good mix of types can be really effective. Rock is great for defense and can cover ground types. Dark type is versatile with moves like Sucker Punch or Toxic Spikes, which can be useful against certain opponents. Flying type is strong offensively with moves like Air Attack and Electric-type moves.

But since their last team lost, maybe adding more offensive or defensive Pokémon could help. I should look for high HP Pokémon to boost defense. Also, considering the types that are underrepresented in their previous team might be beneficial.

Looking at the roster, I see several options that might fit well. For example, PkmTemplate 26 is Rock/Dark with high HP (153) and strong moves like Stone Edge and Rock Slide. That could provide solid ground coverage. Then, maybe adding a Ghost type for good defense against certain types and to help with status moves.

I also notice that PkmTemplate 30 is Flying with decent stats. Maybe keeping a flying Pokémon would be good for aerial attacks and coverage. But perhaps replacing one of the previous ones if it's not performing well in the current context.

Wait, but the user might prefer having specific types that were previously successful. Their last winning team had Rock/Dark, Ghost, and Flying. Since their last team lost, maybe adding more support types or specialized attackers could help.

Another thought: the user's Elo dropped slightly, so they might need a stronger team to regain their competitive edge. High HP Pokémon can survive longer in battles, which is crucial for maintaining momentum.

Looking at the available templates again, PkmTemplate 26 has high max HP and strong moves. Maybe that's a good choice. Then, perhaps another Ghost type for better defense, like PkmTemplate 32 or 19. And maybe a Flying Pokémon with good stats, such as PkmTemplate 30.

I should also consider the types they have covered. Rock/Dark covers Ground and Rock types, but if the opposing team has Water or Grass, having a Water resister would be helpful. But since their last team lost, maybe focusing on tanky Pokémon to absorb attacks.

Wait, another angle: in the previous battle, their team might have been weak against certain types. So, perhaps adding a type that counters those weaknesses could improve their chances.

Alternatively, if their last loss was due to a lack of coverage or specific moves, selecting Pokémon with versatile and strong moves could help. For example, having multiple Electric-type moves for coverage against Flying and Water types.

I'm also noticing that some Pokémon have unique abilities like Target Boosts, which can boost the effectiveness of their moves when used multiple times. That might be an advantage in certain situations.

So, putting it all together, I think selecting high HP, strong defensive types along with versatile attackers would be a good strategy. PkmTemplate 26 for Rock/Dark, PkmTemplate 32 for Ghost, and maybe PkmTemplate 30 for Flying seem like solid choices. Alternatively, if the user prefers different types, other options could be better.

But considering their previous team's success with these indices, it might make sense to stick with similar strong performers but perhaps replace one or two with more effective options based on current roster strengths.

Okay, so I need to figure out a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The user's last battle resulted in a loss, with an Elo rating of 1147.44. Their previous team used indices [26, 32, 30]. Now, they want to choose a new team from the roster that maximizes their chances of winning the next battle.

First, I'll look at the types of the previous team. Indices 26, 32, and 30 correspond to:

- Index 26: Rock/Dark type with high HP.
- Index 32: Ghost type with good stats.
- Index 30: Flying type with decent moves.

Since their last team lost, I should consider strategies that could improve their chances. Maybe adding types that are strong against the previous opponents or have synergy.

Looking at the current roster, there are several options. I need to pick three Pokémon that can complement each other and possibly counter the opponent's types.

I notice that many teams include Ghost, Rock, or Dark types, which are versatile. Also, having a mix of types that cover multiple weaknesses could be beneficial.

Let me consider some strong candidates:

- Index 14: Water type with good moves, including Flying and Ground.
- Index 19: Ghost with high HP and useful moves like Water and Dragon.
- Index 30: Already used, but maybe it's still a good choice if the user wants to keep one from their previous team for familiarity.

Wait, the user might benefit from having a mix of types that are strong in different aspects. Maybe adding a Rock type for defense, a Ghost type for versatility, and a Water type for coverage.

So, considering:

- Index 14: Water, which can be good against Fire and Grass.
- Index 19: Ghost, which is good against Dark and has access to moves like Water, making it versatile.
- Index 26: Rock/Dark, providing both types with strong defensive capabilities.

Alternatively, another combination could be:

- Index 30: Flying for air coverage and Electric moves.
- Index 14: Water for support.
- Index 19: Ghost for all-around use.

I think adding a mix of these types would make the team strong. Maybe [26, 32, 30] again, but perhaps replacing one with a stronger option.

Wait, the previous team used 26 (Rock/Dark), 32 (Ghost), and 30 (Flying). Maybe keeping 32 (Ghost) is good because it's versatile. Adding another Ghost could be redundant, so maybe replacing one.

Alternatively, adding more types that are strong against common opponents. For example, if the opponent has Grass or Water types, having a Rock type would be beneficial.

But without knowing the exact opponent's team, it's hard to tailor specifically. So, I'll aim for a balanced team with good coverage and high HP.

Looking at other options:

- Index 14: Water, which is strong against Fire and Grass.
- Index 19: Ghost, which can handle various types and has good stats.
- Index 26: Rock/Dark, providing both defense and offensive capabilities.

So, the new team would be [14, 19, 26]. Alternatively, considering other indices that might provide better synergy or stats.

Wait, maybe including a Dragon type could add some surprise. But I don't see many Dragon templates in the top performers. Maybe not necessary.

Another approach: choose the highest Max HP Pokémon to maximize survivability. So looking at higher HP:

- Index 19: 160 HP
- Index 26: 153 HP
- Index 14: 122 HP

But maybe combining high HP with strong moves is better.

Alternatively, considering the types that can cover multiple weaknesses and have strong move sets.

I think a team of Ghost, Rock/Dark, and Water would be versatile. So indices [19 (Ghost), 26 (Rock/Dark), 14 (Water)] seems like a solid choice.

Okay, so I need to help create a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, the user mentioned that their last team won, with Elo increasing to 1158.03. The previous team indices were [19, 26, 29]. Wait, no, correction: the user listed two past teams: [19,26,29] and [14,19,26], but in the query, the previous team is given as [14,19,26]. So I need to focus on that.

The Roster includes 49 Pokémon templates with specific types, Max HP, and moves. The goal is to choose three that can maximize chances in the next battle. Since the last team won, we might want to keep some effective strategies or types that worked before but also consider others for variety or improved stats.

Looking at the previous team: indices 14,19,26. Let me check those templates:

- Index 14: Type WATER, Max HP 122. Moves include Flying, Change Type, etc.
- Index 19: Type GHOST, Max HP 160. Moves like Water, Protect, Dragon, etc.
- Index 26: Type ROCK/DARK, Max HP 153. Moves with Poison, Sand, Flying, etc.

So the previous team had a mix of types: Rock/Dark, Ghost, and Water. Maybe the next team should maintain some of these types for consistency or synergy but also include others that might be strong against common enemies or have good movesets.

Now, looking through the Roster to find other strong Pokémon:

- Index 29: FIRE/DARK, Max HP 160. Moves include Steel, Ground, Sun, etc. This could complement a Ghost type with Burn or other Fire weaknesses.
- Index 30: FLYING, Max HP 100. Electric moves might pair well with Water or Ice types for Electro Crossover or other advantages.
- Index 49: FIGHT, Max HP 74. Flying and Rock moves could provide physical damage and utility.

Wait, but index 49 has a lower HP than others, but maybe it's compensated by high attack or useful moves like Tailwind.

Alternatively, looking at other indices:

- Index 26 is already used, so I shouldn't repeat unless necessary.
- Maybe include a Grass type for coverage against Fire and Water, but not sure if that's needed.
- Alternatively, considering types that are strong against each other could create a balanced team.

Wait, perhaps the user wants to avoid using the same types as before. The previous team had Rock/Dark, Ghost, Water. So maybe include types like Grass, Electric, or Ice to mix it up.

Looking at index 30: Flying/Normal? Wait no, index 30 is FLYING, Type FLYING, Max HP 100. It has Electric moves which could synergize with Water for Electro Crossover.

Alternatively, maybe choose a Electric type for better neutral coverage, but I need to see the types and their effectiveness.

Wait, perhaps the user wants to include strong attackers or Defenders. Let me think about the types:

- Ghost is good against Possessing, Dark types.
- Rock is good against Ghosts and Steels.
- Water can be strong against Fire and Ground.
- Electric is good against Water and Ground.
- Dark is good against Grass and Beasts.
- Rock can also handle Steel and some others.

So maybe the new team should have a mix of types that can cover each other's weaknesses. For example, having Electric (to counter Water) and Dark (to counter Grass), but I need three Pokémon.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to stick with winning combinations. Since the last team won, maybe include similar strengths.

But without knowing the exact opponent types or strategies, it's a bit tricky. However, the task is to choose the best possible team from the Roster based on prior info.

I think the previous team used indices 14 (Water),19 (Ghost),26(Rock/Dark). The new team could include similar types for consistency but with possibly higher HP or better move sets.

Looking at index 30: FLYING, Max HP 100. It has Electric moves which can be useful against Water opponents.

Index 29: FIRE/DARK, Max HP 160. This is a strong Fire/Dark type with good stats.

Index 49: FIGHT, Max HP 74. It's a Fighthing type with Flying and Rock moves, which can be good for physical attacks.

Alternatively, maybe include index 30 (Flying), 29 (Fire/Dark), and another strong type like Electric or Grass. But I need to pick three.

Wait, perhaps the user wants to avoid using the same types as before. The previous team had Water, Ghost, Rock/Dark. So adding Fire, Electric, and maybe another type.

Looking at index 30: FLYING/Normal? No, index 30 is just Flying, Type FLYING. It's moves include Electric, which could be useful against Water.

So perhaps the new team would be:

- Index 29: FIRE/DARK
- Index 30: FLYING
- Index 49: FIGHT

This gives a mix of Fire, Dark, and Fighting types, which can cover each other's weaknesses. For example, Dark resists Grass, Fire is strong against Grass, and Fighting can handle Ice.

Alternatively, if I consider index 14 (Water), but maybe not since the user might want to rotate. Or perhaps include another strong Water type.

Wait, but the previous team had a Water, so maybe not overuse it unless necessary. So perhaps go with Fire/Dark, Flying/Electric, and a strong Ghost or Rock type.

Alternatively, index 30 (Flying), index 29 (Fire/Dark), and index 26 (Rock/Dark). But 26 was used before.

Hmm, the user provided the previous team as [14,19,26], so I should not repeat those unless necessary.

So maybe choose indices:

- 29: FIRE/DARK
- 30: FLYING
- 49: FIGHT

These are all different from the previous team and cover Fire, Dark, and Fighting types. Alternatively, perhaps include a Ghost type as well for better coverage against certain types.

Wait, looking at index 19 is Ghost, but it was used before. So maybe not use it again unless necessary.

Alternatively, if I go with 29 (Fire/Dark), 30 (Flying), and another strong type like Electric. But the only Electric types not in previous team are indices 0,7,16, etc., but need to pick three.

Wait, perhaps index 30 is Electric? No, index 30 is Flying, Type FLYING with Electric moves.

So maybe include index 29 (Fire/Dark), index 30 (Flying/Electric), and index 14 (Water). But 14 was used before.

Alternatively, choose index 26: Rock/Dark, but it was used. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to pick three that are strong in terms of Max HP and have good move sets. For example:

- Index 19: Ghost, high HP 160.
- Index 29: Fire/Dark, high HP 160.
- Index 30: Flying, Max HP 100.

Alternatively, maybe include index 26 (Rock/Dark), but it was used before. So perhaps go with 29,30, and another strong type like Electric.

Wait, the user might prefer higher HP for survivability. Indexes 19 and 29 have high HP (160). Maybe pair them with a strong Flying or Electric type.

So maybe 19 (Ghost), 29 (Fire/Dark), and 30 (Flying/Electric).

But I need to ensure they are different from the previous team [14,19,26]. So cannot include 19 again. So perhaps 29,30, and another index not used before.

Looking at index 49: FIGHT, HP 74. Maybe it's a good choice for physical attacks but lower HP.

Alternatively, pick index 30 (Flying), which is strong with Electric moves, and then find two others that are strong.

Wait, perhaps the best strategy is to choose the top three in terms of Max HP that cover different types without overlapping previous team.

Looking at the Roster, the highest HP are:

- Index 18: 160
- Index 19: 160
- Index 20: 140
- Index 21: 99
- ... and so on.

But considering the types and moves. Alternatively, look for types that can cover each other's weaknesses.

Given that the previous team was [14 (Water),19(Ghost),26(Rock/Dark)], maybe choose Fire, Electric, and another strong type.

Wait, perhaps pick:

- Index 29: FIRE/DARK
- Index 30: FLYING/?
- Index 14: WATER

But 14 was used before. So maybe not.

Alternatively, choose:

- Index 26 (Rock/Dark): but it's in the previous team.
- Index 19 (Ghost): also in previous team.

Hmm, tricky.

Maybe go with Fire, Electric, and a strong Rock type. But need three indices.

Wait, perhaps pick index 29 (Fire/Dark), index 30 (Flying/Electric), and index 35 (Rock). But I don't know if 35 is allowed.

Alternatively, the user wants to maximize chance, so maybe go with the previous team plus a new type, but without repeating too much.

Wait, perhaps it's better to choose three that are strong in their types and have good moves. Maybe:

- 29: Fire/Dark (high HP, good moves)
- 30: Flying (good Electric moves)
- 49: Fight (high physical attacks)

Yes, these three together can cover multiple types and have decent stats.

So the new team would be indices 29,30,49.

Alright, so I need to help build a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that the previous team won, which suggests that the strategies of those Pokémon were effective in the last battle. The indices used last time were [29, 30, 49]. So, let me look at what each of these Pokémon are.

- Index 29: Type is FIRE/DARK, Max_HP=160. The moves include Steel, Power 74, etc.
- Index 30: Type FLYING, Max_HP=100. Moves include Electric and Normal.
- Index 49: Type FIGHT, Max_HP=74. Moves include Flying and Rock.

So, the last team had a mix of Fire/Dark, Flying, and another type that's not immediately clear. Since they won, I should consider what made them successful. Maybe their types covered multiple elements or had strong moves.

Now, looking at the current Roster, there are 50 Pokémon templates. I need to choose three that can complement each other. The goal is to maximize chances in the next battle. 

I should think about type coverage: having Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, etc., so they can cover different weaknesses and resistances. Also, considering their moves, accuracy, PP, and other stats.

Let me look through the Roster to find strong candidates:

- Index 0: Electric/Steel with decent HP and multiple moves.
- Index 1: Grass/Water, which could pair well with Water or Grass types.
- Index 2: Flying/Ice. Flying is good for aerial attacks.
- Index 3: Steel/Poison. Good for STAB and defense.
- Index 4: Ice. Could be useful against Ice types or provide support.
- Index 5: Ice/ Poison. Another Ice type with poison moves.
- Index 6: Ghost/Fight. Ghost is good for resistances, especially against Fighting's weakness.
- Index 7: Electric. High HP and solid moves.
- Index 8: Ghost. Good defensive type.
- Index 9: Water/Normal. Useful for Water coverage.
- Index 10: Electric. Another Electric type with good stats.
- Index 11: Flying. Similar to index 30, which was used before.
- Index 12: Fairy. Could add a fairy element.
- Index 13: Bug/Steel. Good for both bug and steel moves.
- Index 14: Water. Good for water attacks.
- Index 15: Dragon. Can handle dragon moves but might be less useful unless needed.
- Index 16: Fairy/Electric. Adds fairy and electric types.
- Index 17: Dark/ Poison. Useful against dark and poison enemies.
- Index 18: Fairy/Psychic. Good for both fairy and psychic coverage.
- Index 19: Ghost. Another ghost type, which is good defensively.
- Index 20: Grass. Covers grass.
- Index 21: Ground. Ground is useful for ground moves.
- Index 22: Psychic/Fairy. Adds both psychic and fairy.
- Index 23: Electric/Bug. Combines electric and bug.
- Index 24: Normal. A solid all-rounder.
- Index 25: Dragon/Psychic. Can handle dragon and psychic.
- Index 26: Rock/Dark. Good for rock and dark moves.
- Index 27: Ghost. Another ghost.
- Index 28: Grass. Another grass.
- Index 29: Fire/Dark, which was used before.
- Index 30: Flying, also used before.
- Index 31: Ghost. Again, another ghost.
- Index 32: Psychic. Adds psychic coverage.
- Index 33: Water. Another water type.
- Index 34: Fire/Flying. Combines fire and flying.
- Index 35: Rock. Good for rock moves.
- Index 36: Ghost. Yet another ghost.
- Index 37: Poison/Water. Covers poison and water.
- Index 38: Bug/Dark. Adds bug and dark.
- Index 39: Ground. Another ground type.
- Index 40: Fight. Useful for fighting moves.
- Index 41: Steel. Good for steel moves.
- Index 42: Psychic/Grass. Adds psychic and grass.
- Index 43: Steel/Rock. Combines steel and rock.
- Index 44: Ice. Another ice type.
- Index 45: Dark. Covers dark.
- Index 46: Bug. Adds bug.
- Index 47: Grass. Another grass.
- Index 48: Fairy. Yet another fairy.
- Index 49: Fight, which was used before.

So, considering the previous team had indices 29 (Fire/Dark), 30 (Flying), and 49 (Fight). The new team should aim for types that complement these but also provide coverage against common weaknesses. Since Fire/Dark is already in the last team, maybe adding types that counter or support it could be beneficial.

Looking at index 0: Electric/Steel. Electric can help against Flying and Ground types. Steel covers Ground and Rock. This seems like a solid choice because it provides both Electric and Steel coverage.

Index 1: Grass/Water. Water is good for Fighting moves, and Grass can handle Grass enemies. Plus, Water can support the team by covering multiple types.

Index 19: Ghost. Ghost is excellent for defensive purposes, especially against Fighting's weakness to Ghost. It also covers a variety of moves like Haunt and Shadow Force.

Alternatively, index 14: Water could be another option, but I think Grass/Water (index1) provides more versatility with Grass coverage as well.

So, considering all this, the new team would consist of indices 0 (Electric/Steel), 1 (Grass/Water), and 19 (Ghost). This combination covers Electric, Steel, Grass, Water, and Ghost types, which should provide a well-rounded team.

Alright, so I need to help this user choose a new Pokémon team based on the given information. Let me break down what's provided.

First, the user mentioned it's their first battle, so there's no prior result to consider. That means I can't look back at past wins or losses to guide my choices. My main goal is to select three Pokémon that will maximize their chances in the next battle.

Looking at the Roster, there are 50 templates, each with Type, Max_HP, and various moves. Since it's the first time, I should probably focus on having a balanced team rather than specific strategies. Balancing types can help against different opponents, so maybe I'll try to include a variety of types.

I need to pick three indices from the list provided (0-49). Each index corresponds to a Pokémon with specific attributes. I'll have to evaluate each Pokémon's Type, their moves, and other stats like Max_HP to gauge their effectiveness.

Since it's the first battle, maybe having high Max_HP could be beneficial to withstand more damage. Also, considering moves that are strong against common types or have good accuracy and power might give an edge.

Let me go through some of the higher Max_HP Pokémon because they can survive longer in battles. For example, indices 0 has Rock with Max_HP 116, which is pretty high. Then there's index 7 with Rock/Electric at 159 HP. That seems like a solid choice because Electric attacks are strong against many types.

Looking for another type, maybe something that covers multiple weaknesses. Index 30 is Ghost/Dark with 135 HP. Dark moves can be versatile, and having a high HP could help in tough matchups.

For the third Pokémon, I want something that can cover another weakness or add more versatility. Maybe a Dragon/Grass type, like index 8, which has Max_HP 140. Dragon types are strong against Ice and some others, and Grass adds further coverage.

Wait, but maybe I should also consider special moves with high power. For example, index 1 is Electric/Steel with Max_PP 10 on Special moves, which could be powerful. But its HP is only 106, so it might be riskier in a battle.

Alternatively, index 14 is Fire with 160 HP and some strong moves like Normal and Faerie types. Fire can be good against Grass and Water, but I'm not sure if that's the best for this scenario.

I think sticking with high HP and versatile types would be better. So perhaps indices 0 (Rock), 7 (Rock/Electric), and 8 (Dragon/Grass). Rock is strong against many types like Ice and Bug, Electric adds another layer of effectiveness against types like Ground and Steel, and Dragon/Grass can handle Ice and Grass opponents.

Wait, but I need to ensure that each Pokémon's moves complement the team. For instance, if I have a Rock type with Toxic Spikes, it might be useful against certain enemies. The Electric type might have moves like Thunder which can be strong.

Alternatively, maybe a Ghost/Dark type could help with intimidation or status moves, but I'm not sure how effective that is in the first battle without prior data.

Another consideration: some Pokémon have multiple types, which can provide more flexibility. For example, index 30 is Ghost/Dark, which might be good against both Psychic and Normal types.

I think the key here is to balance between high HP, strong moves, and type coverage. So perhaps selecting indices that offer a mix of these would be best. Maybe index 0 (Rock) for versatility, index 7 (Rock/Electric) for additional effectiveness, and index 30 (Ghost/Dark) for unique types.

But I'm not entirely sure if this is the optimal combination. Alternatively, maybe including an Electric/Steel type like index 1 could provide strong Special moves, but again, the HP is lower.

I might be overcomplicating it. Since it's the first battle, maybe just picking three strong single-type Pokémon could work. For example, Fire, Water, Grass. But looking at the roster, there are multiple types available, so maybe a mix of Rock, Electric, and something else.

Wait, another approach: look for Pokémon with high Max_HP and good accuracy and power in their moves. For instance, index 0 has Ground moves with high PP, which is good for reliability. Index 7 has both Rock and Electric moves, which can be very effective against many enemies. Index 30 has Ghost/Dark moves, which might not be as directly powerful but could have some utility.

Alternatively, perhaps selecting a Fire type for its strong offensive capabilities (index 14), an Electric/Steel for defense and Special attacks (index1), and a Rock type for versatility (index0). But I'm not certain if that's the best fit.

I think I need to make a calculated guess based on the available data. High HP, good moves, and type coverage seem essential. So, perhaps indices 7 (Rock/Electric), 30 (Ghost/Dark), and 8 (Dragon/Grass) would provide a balanced team with strong individual strengths.

Okay, so I need to figure out what three Pokémon from the given roster would be the best choice for the next battle. The user provided a lot of information, including the previous team's indices [0,7,30], and some summary about the last result which says "Your last team won. Your new Elo is 1215.00." So I guess that means my last three Pokémon did well, so maybe I should stick with similar strategies or types.

First, I'll look at the previous team: indices 0,7,30. Let's check their types and moves to understand what they are strong against.

- Index 0 is Rock/Electric. Its moves include Ground, Power 16, Max PP 12, Physical, Probability 0.89, Toxic Spikes, Psychic, Power 20, etc.
- Index 7 is Rock/Electric with higher HP (159) and some powerful moves like Normal, Accuracy 0.93, Max PP 9, Trickroom, Psychic, etc.
- Index 30 is Ghost/Dark. Its moves include Water, Power 88, Accuracy 0.83, Physical, Priority 1, Probability 0.37, Sun, Fire, etc.

So the previous team had Rock/Electric, which can cover both Ground and Electric types, and a Ghost/Dark type for coverage against certain opponents. Maybe they were good because of their type combinations and strong moves.

Now, looking at the new roster, I need to pick three Pokémon that can complement each other and cover multiple types effectively. Let's go through some options:

Starting with Rock/Electric again (index 7) makes sense because it's a strong attacker with high HP and useful moves like Trickroom and Reflect. It can handle both physical and special attacks.

Next, considering another type to support. Maybe Electric/Dark or something that covers multiple weaknesses. Looking at index 14: Fire type. It has Normal moves which might be useful against Ghost types, but since we already have a Dark/Ghost in the previous team, maybe it's better to avoid Fire unless it's necessary.

Wait, no, the previous team included a Ghost/Dark (index30). So adding another type that complements without overlapping would be good. Maybe Electric/Dark or Ice/Steel for coverage against multiple types.

Looking at index 48: Ice/Steel with high HP and strong moves like Reflect and Trickroom. It can cover Steel resistance and Ice coverage, which is useful. Plus, it has a heal ability, which could help in tough battles.

Alternatively, index 49 is Grass type. It might be weak against Fire but strong against others. However, considering the previous team's success with Ghost/Dark and Rock/Electric, adding another Electric/Dark or Ice/Steel might provide better coverage.

Wait, maybe I should look for types that are strong against what the previous opponents might have been weak against. If the last team won, perhaps their moves were effective against certain types. For example, the Rock/Electric can hit Ground and Electric types effectively, while Ghost/Dark can handle things like Water and Fire.

So, to maximize effectiveness, I should pick a Pokémon that covers another strong type that's not yet covered. Looking at index 48: Ice/Steel is resistant to many types and has moves like Reflect and Trickroom which are useful against multiple opponents.

But wait, the last team had Rock/Electric (index7) and Ghost/Dark (30). So if I pick another Electric/Dark, that might be redundant. Maybe a third type that's strong against common enemies.

Alternatively, index 31: Grass/Psychic. It could cover Grass and Psychic types, which are good for various matchups. But maybe not as strong as Ice/Steel.

Another option is index 37: Dark/Steel. That would provide both Dark and Steel resistance, which is good because the previous team's Ghost/Dark can already cover some of these.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the three Pokémon together are strong against a variety of types. So maybe:

- Keep index7 (Rock/Electric) for coverage on Ground and Electric.
- Add index30 (Ghost/Dark) again? But no, I can't repeat indices because each battle is a new team.

Wait, no, the previous team used 0,7,30. Now I need to choose three from the entire roster, not limited to those. So perhaps:

- Choose index7: Rock/Electric for Ground and Electric coverage.
- Choose index48: Ice/Steel for Ice and Steel coverage.
- Then a third Pokémon that covers another strong type.

What's left? Maybe index 49: Grass. It can cover Grass and has some good moves, but it might be weak against Fire.

Alternatively, index 37: Dark/Steel for better coverage on Dark types and Steel resistance.

Wait, let me think about the types of the previous team:

- Rock (0) covers Ground.
- Electric (7) covers Electric.
- Ghost/Dark (30) can handle Water and Fire, and also has Sun support which is good against Fire moves.

So to counter a wide range of opponents, adding Ice/Steel would cover Ice and Steel types, which are strong against many others. Then, perhaps a third type that's strong against Grass or another common type.

Looking at index 31: Grass/Psychic. It covers Grass and Psychic. Psychic can handle Fighting and Water, so that might be useful.

Alternatively, index 32: Rock with higher PP and other moves. But maybe not as effective as others.

Wait, but the last team had three strong attackers, so perhaps I should focus on high HP and strong moves. Index7 has 159 HP, which is very high, so it's a good keeper.

Index30 has 135 HP, which is decent. Maybe adding another high HP Pokémon would help in maintaining health during battles.

Looking at index48: Ice/Steel with 155 HP, that's even higher. So maybe that's a good third member.

Then, for the third, perhaps index14: Fire. It can handle Normal types and has some strong moves like Power 90 and Max PP 10. Plus, Fire is useful against Grass and Water, which are common in many matchups.

Alternatively, index49: Grass with 69 HP might be a bit low compared to others, but it's versatile.

Wait, perhaps I should go for higher HP to survive longer. So indices7 (159), 30 (135), and 48 (155) would form a strong team with high HP and good type coverage.

But the user wants exactly three indices, so maybe 7,30,48?

Alternatively, check if any of these have overlapping types that could be redundant. Rock/Electric and Ghost/Dark are different from Ice/Steel, so they provide good coverage.

So, I think the optimal team would be:

- index7: Rock/Electric for Ground and Electric.
- index30: Ghost/Dark for Water and Fire.
- index48: Ice/Steel for Ice and Steel.

This covers a wide range of types and provides strong defensive capabilities through their types. Also, index48 has heals, which could help in maintaining HP.

So the final answer would be ---7, 30, 48---.
