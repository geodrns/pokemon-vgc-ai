This is my submission.

There are five files. The first file is Jo_BattlePolicies8.py, which should be in the same agent directory as Example_BattleEcosystem.py.
The second file is Jo_Competitor_fake.py, which serves the same role as Example_Competitor.py.
The third file is Jo_RemoteCompetitor_fake.py, which serves the same role as Example_RemoteChampionshipEcosystem.py.
The fourth file is Jo_TeamBuildPolicies2.py, which serves the same role as Example_Teambuild.py.
The fifth file is Jo_TeamSelectionPolicies.py, which supports Jo_TeamBuildPolicies2.py, and both files should be in the same location.

I am from Chonnam National University in South Korea.
I would like to thank the organizers of the competition.
