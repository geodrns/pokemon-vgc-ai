To run my bot, follow these steps

1. Navigate to the directory where the "MyRemoteCompetitor.py" file is located in a Terminal.
2. Run the following command to run MyBattlePolicy => "python MyRemoteCompetitor.py --id <agent_id>"

Replace <agent_id> with the desired ID for the agent. The agent will listen on the remote port "5000 + <agent_id>.

Thank you.
